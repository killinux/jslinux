he `_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine is responsible for reading all the
symbols from the object file and passing the correct information to
`_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol'.

   The `_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine should not use
`bfd_canonicalize_symtab' to read the symbols.  The point of providing
this routine is to avoid the overhead of converting the symbols into
generic `asymbol' structures.

   `_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol' handles the details of combining
common symbols, warning about multiple definitions, and so forth.  It
takes arguments which describe the symbol to add, notably symbol flags,
a section, and an offset.  The symbol flags include such things as
`BSF_WEAK' or `BSF_INDIRECT'.  The section is a section in the object
file, or something like `bfd_und_section_ptr' for an undefined symbol
or `bfd_com_section_ptr' for a common symbol.

   If the `_bfd_final_link' routine is also going to need to read the
symbol information, the `_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine should save it
somewhere attached to the object file BFD.  However, the information
should only be saved if the `keep_memory' field of the `info' argument
is TRUE, so that the `-no-keep-memory' linker switch is effective.

   The a.out function which adds symbols from an object file is
`aout_link_add_object_symbols', and most of the interesting work is in
`aout_link_add_symbols'.  The latter saves pointers to the hash tables
entries created by `_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol' indexed by symbol
number, so that the `_bfd_final_link' routine does not have to call the
hash table lookup routine to locate the entry.

2.17.2.3 Adding symbols from an archive
.......................................

When the `_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine is passed an archive, it must
look through the symbols defined by the archive and decide which
elements of the archive should be included in the link.  For each such
element it must call the `add_archive_element' linker callback, and it
must add the symbols from the object file to the linker hash table.
(The callback may in fact indicate that a replacement BFD should be
used, in which case the symbols from that BFD should be added to the
linker hash table instead.)

   In most cases the work of looking through the symbols in the archive
should be done by the `_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols' function.
This function builds a hash table from the archive symbol table and
looks through the list of undefined symbols to see which elements
should be included.  `_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols' is passed
a function to call to make the final decision about adding an archive
element to the link and to do the actual work of adding the symbols to
the linker hash table.

   The function passed to `_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols' must
read the symbols of the archive element and decide whether the archive
element should be included in the link.  If the element is to be
included, the `add_archive_element' linker callback routine must be
called with the element as an argument, and the element's symbols must
be added to the linker hash table just as though the element had itself
been passed to the `_bfd_link_add_symbols' function.  The
`add_archive_element' callback has the option to indicate that it would
like to replace the element archive with a substitute BFD, in which
case it is the symbols of that substitute BFD that must be added to the
linker hash table instead.

   When the a.out `_bfd_link_add_symbols' function receives an archive,
it calls `_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols' passing
`aout_link_check_archive_element' as the function argument.
`aout_link_check_archive_element' calls `aout_link_check_ar_symbols'.
If the latter decides to add the element (an element is only added if
it provides a real, non-common, definition for a previously undefined
or common symbol) it calls the `add_archive_element' callback and then
`aout_link_check_archive_element' calls `aout_link_add_symbols' to
actually add the symbols to the linker hash table - possibly those of a
substitute BFD, if the `add_archive_element' callback avails itself of
that option.

   The ECOFF back end is unusual in that it does not normally call
`_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols', because ECOFF archives already
contain a hash table of symbols.  The ECOFF back end searches the
archive itself to avoid the overhead of creating a new hash table.

2.17.3 Performing the final link
--------------------------------

When all the input files have been processed, the linker calls the
`_bfd_final_link' entry point of the output BFD.  This routine is
responsible for producing the final output file, which has several
aspects.  It must relocate the contents of the input sections and copy
the data into the output sections.  It must build an output symbol
table including any local symbols from the input files and the global
symbols from the hash table.  When producing relocatable output, it must
modify the input relocs and write them into the output file.  There may
also be object format dependent work to be done.

   The linker will also call the `write_object_contents' entry point
when the BFD is closed.  The two entry points must work together in
order to produce the correct output file.

   The details of how this works are inevitably dependent upon the
specific object file format.  The a.out `_bfd_final_link' routine is
`NAME(aout,final_link)'.

2.17.3.1 Information provided by the linker
...........................................

Before the linker calls the `_bfd_final_link' entry point, it sets up
some data structures for the function to use.

   The `input_bfds' field of the `bfd_link_info' structure will point
to a list of all the input files included in the link.  These files are
linked through the `link_next' field of the `bfd' structure.

   Each section in the output file will have a list of `link_order'
structures attached to the `map_head.link_order' field (the
`link_order' structure is defined in `bfdlink.h').  These structures
describe how to create the contents of the output section in terms of
the contents of various input sections, fill constants, and,
eventually, other types of information.  They also describe relocs that
must be created by the BFD backend, but do not correspond to any input
file; this is used to support -Ur, which builds constructors while
generating a relocatable object file.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Relocating the section contents,  Next: Writing the symbol table,  Prev: Information provided by the linker,  Up: Performing the Final Link

2.17.3.2 Relocating the section contents
........................................

The `_bfd_final_link' function should look through the `link_order'
structures attached to each section of the output file.  Each
`link_order' structure should either be handled specially, or it should
be passed to the function `_bfd_default_link_order' which will do the
right thing (`_bfd_default_link_order' is defined in `linker.c').

   For efficiency, a `link_order' of type `bfd_indirect_link_order'
whose associated section belongs to a BFD of the same format as the
output BFD must be handled specially.  This type of `link_order'
describes part of an output section in terms of a section belonging to
one of the input files.  The `_bfd_final_link' function should read the
contents of the section and any associated relocs, apply the relocs to
the section contents, and write out the modified section contents.  If
performing a relocatable link, the relocs themselves must also be
modified and written out.

   The functions `_bfd_relocate_contents' and
`_bfd_final_link_relocate' provide some general support for performing
the actual relocations, notably overflow checking.  Their arguments
include information about the symbol the relocation is against and a
`reloc_howto_type' argument which describes the relocation to perform.
These functions are defined in `reloc.c'.

   The a.out function which handles reading, relocating, and writing
section contents is `aout_link_input_section'.  The actual relocation
is done in `aout_link_input_section_std' and
`aout_link_input_section_ext'.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Writing the symbol table,  Prev: Relocating the section contents,  Up: Performing the Final Link

2.17.3.3 Writing the symbol table
.................................

The `_bfd_final_link' function must gather all the symbols in the input
files and write them out.  It must also write out all the symbols in
the global hash table.  This must be controlled by the `strip' and
`discard' fields of the `bfd_link_info' structure.

   The local symbols of the input files will not have been entered into
the linker hash table.  The `_bfd_final_link' routine must consider
each input file and include the symbols in the output file.  It may be
convenient to do this when looking through the `link_order' structures,
or it may be done by stepping through the `input_bfds' list.

   The `_bfd_final_link' routine must also traverse the global hash
table to gather all the externally visible symbols.  It is possible
that most of the externally visible symbols may be written out when
considering the symbols of each input file, but it is still necessary
to traverse the hash table since the linker script may have defined
some symbols that are not in any of the input files.

   The `strip' field of the `bfd_link_info' structure controls which
symbols are written out.  The possible values are listed in
`bfdlink.h'.  If the value is `strip_some', then the `keep_hash' field
of the `bfd_link_info' structure is a hash table of symbols to keep;
each symbol should be looked up in this hash table, and only symbols
which are present should be included in the output file.

   If the `strip' field of the `bfd_link_info' structure permits local
symbols to be written out, the `discard' field is used to further
controls which local symbols are included in the output file.  If the
value is `discard_l', then all local symbols which begin with a certain
prefix are discarded; this is controlled by the
`bfd_is_local_label_name' entry point.

   The a.out backend handles symbols by calling
`aout_link_write_symbols' on each input BFD and then traversing the
global hash table with the function `aout_link_write_other_symbol'.  It
builds a string table while writing out the symbols, which is written
to the output file at the end of `NAME(aout,final_link)'.

2.18 Hash Tables
================

BFD provides a simple set of hash table functions.  Routines are
provided to initialize a hash table, to free a hash table, to look up a
string in a hash table and optionally create an entry for it, and to
traverse a hash table.  There is currently no routine to delete an
string from a hash table.

   The basic hash table does not permit any data to be stored with a
string.  However, a hash table is designed to present a base class from
which other types of hash tables may be derived.  These derived types
may store additional information with the string.  Hash tables were
implemented in this way, rather than simply providing a data pointer in
a hash table entry, because they were designed for use by the linker
back ends.  The linker may create thousands of hash table entries, and
the overhead of allocating private data and storing and following
pointers becomes noticeable.

   The basic hash table code is in `hash.c'.

2.18.1 Creating and freeing a hash table
----------------------------------------

To create a hash table, create an instance of a `struct bfd_hash_table'
(defined in `bfd.h') and call `bfd_hash_table_init' (if you know
approximately how many entries you will need, the function
`bfd_hash_table_init_n', which takes a SIZE argument, may be used).
`bfd_hash_table_init' returns `FALSE' if some sort of error occurs.

   The function `bfd_hash_table_init' take as an argument a function to
use to create new entries.  For a basic hash table, use the function
`bfd_hash_newfunc'.  *Note Deriving a New Hash Table Type::, for why
you would want to use a different value for this argument.

   `bfd_hash_table_init' will create an objalloc which will be used to
allocate new entries.  You may allocate memory on this objalloc using
`bfd_hash_allocate'.

   Use `bfd_hash_table_free' to free up all the memory that has been
allocated for a hash table.  This will not free up the `struct
bfd_hash_table' itself, which you must provide.

   Use `bfd_hash_set_default_size' to set the default size of hash
table to use.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Looking Up or Entering a String,  Next: Traversing a Hash Table,  Prev: Creating and Freeing a Hash Table,  Up: Hash Tables

2.18.2 Looking up or entering a string
--------------------------------------

The function `bfd_hash_lookup' is used both to look up a string in the
hash table and to create a new entry.

   If the CREATE argument is `FALSE', `bfd_hash_lookup' will look up a
string.  If the string is found, it will returns a pointer to a `struct
bfd_hash_entry'.  If the string is not found in the table
`bfd_hash_lookup' will return `NULL'.  You should not modify any of the
fields in the returns `struct bfd_hash_entry'.

   If the CREATE argument is `TRUE', the string will be entered into
the hash table if it is not already there.  Either way a pointer to a
`struct bfd_hash_entry' will be returned, either to the existing
structure or to a newly created one.  In this case, a `NULL' return
means that an error occurred.

   If the CREATE argument is `TRUE', and a new entry is created, the
COPY argument is used to decide whether to copy the string onto the
hash table objalloc or not.  If COPY is passed as `FALSE', you must be
careful not to deallocate or modify the string as long as the hash table
exists.

2.18.3 Traversing a hash table
------------------------------

The function `bfd_hash_traverse' may be used to traverse a hash table,
calling a function on each element.  The traversal is done in a random
order.

   `bfd_hash_traverse' takes as arguments a function and a generic
`void *' pointer.  The function is called with a hash table entry (a
`struct bfd_hash_entry *') and the generic pointer passed to
`bfd_hash_traverse'.  The function must return a `boolean' value, which
indicates whether to continue traversing the hash table.  If the
function returns `FALSE', `bfd_hash_traverse' will stop the traversal
and return immediately.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Deriving a New Hash Table Type,  Prev: Traversing a Hash Table,  Up: Hash Tables

2.18.4 Deriving a new hash table type
-------------------------------------

Many uses of hash tables want to store additional information which
each entry in the hash table.  Some also find it convenient to store
additional information with the hash table itself.  This may be done
using a derived hash table.

   Since C is not an object oriented language, creating a derived hash
table requires sticking together some boilerplate routines with a few
differences specific to the type of hash table you want to create.

   An example of a derived hash table is the linker hash table.  The
structures for this are defined in `bfdlink.h'.  The functions are in
`linker.c'.

   You may also derive a hash table from an already derived hash table.
For example, the a.out linker backend code uses a hash table derived
from the linker hash table.

File: bfd.info,  Node: Define the Derived Structures,  Next: Write the Derived Creation Routine,  Prev: Deriving a New Hash Table Type,  Up: Deriving a New Hash Table Type

2.18.4.1 Define the derived structures
......................................

You must define a structure for an entry in the hash table, and a
structure for the hash table itself.

   The first field in the structure for an entry in the hash table must
be of the type used for an entry in the hash table you are deriving
from.  If you are deriving from a basic hash table this is `struct
bfd_hash_entry', which is defined in `bfd.h'.  The first field in the
structure for the hash table itself must be of the type of the hash
table you are deriving from itself.  If you are deriving from a basic
hash table, this is `struct bfd_hash_table'.

   For example, the linker hash table defines `struct
bfd_link_hash_entry' (in `bfdlink.h').  The first field, `root', is of
type `struct bfd_hash_entry'.  Similarly, the first field in `struct
bfd_link_hash_table', `table', is of type `struct bfd_hash_table'.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Write the Derived Creation Routine,  Next: Write Other Derived Routines,  Prev: Define the Derived Structures,  Up: Deriving a New Hash Table Type

2.18.4.2 Write the derived creation routine
...........................................

You must write a routine which will create and initialize an entry in
the hash table.  This routine is passed as the function argument to
`bfd_hash_table_init'.

   In order to permit other hash tables to be derived from the hash
table you are creating, this routine must be written in a standard way.

   The first argument to the creation routine is a pointer to a hash
table entry.  This may be `NULL', in which case the routine should
allocate the right amount of space.  Otherwise the space has already
been allocated by a hash table type derived from this one.

   After allocating space, the creation routine must call the creation
routine of the hash table type it is derived from, passing in a pointer
to the space it just allocated.  This will initialize any fields used
by the base hash table.

   Finally the creation routine must initialize any local fields for
the new hash table type.

   Here is a boilerplate example of a creation routine.  FUNCTION_NAME
is the name of the routine.  ENTRY_TYPE is the type of an entry in the
hash table you are creating.  BASE_NEWFUNC is the name of the creation
routine of the hash table type your hash table is derived from.

     struct bfd_hash_entry *
     FUNCTION_NAME (struct bfd_hash_entry *entry,
                          struct bfd_hash_table *table,
                          const char *string)
     {
       struct ENTRY_TYPE *ret = (ENTRY_TYPE *) entry;

      /* Allocate the structure if it has not already been allocated by a
         derived class.  */
       if (ret == NULL)
         {
           ret = bfd_hash_allocate (table, sizeof (* ret));
           if (ret == NULL)
             return NULL;
         }

      /* Call the allocation method of the base class.  */
       ret = ((ENTRY_TYPE *)
             BASE_NEWFUNC ((struct bfd_hash_entry *) ret, table, string));

      /* Initialize the local fields here.  */

       return (struct bfd_hash_entry *) ret;
     }
   *Description*
The creation routine for the linker hash table, which is in `linker.c',
looks just like this example.  FUNCTION_NAME is
`_bfd_link_hash_newfunc'.  ENTRY_TYPE is `struct bfd_link_hash_entry'.
BASE_NEWFUNC is `bfd_hash_newfunc', the creation routine for a basic
hash table.

   `_bfd_link_hash_newfunc' also initializes the local fields in a
linker hash table entry: `type', `written' and `next'.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Write Other Derived Routines,  Prev: Write the Derived Creation Routine,  Up: Deriving a New Hash Table Type

2.18.4.3 Write other derived routines
.....................................

You will want to write other routines for your new hash table, as well.

   You will want an initialization routine which calls the
initialization routine of the hash table you are deriving from and
initializes any other local fields.  For the linker hash table, this is
`_bfd_link_hash_table_init' in `linker.c'.

   You will want a lookup routine which calls the lookup routine of the
hash table you are deriving from and casts the result.  The linker hash
table uses `bfd_link_hash_lookup' in `linker.c' (this actually takes an
additional argument which it uses to decide how to return the looked up
value).

   You may want a traversal routine.  This should just call the
traversal routine of the hash table you are deriving from with
appropriate casts.  The linker hash table uses `bfd_link_hash_traverse'
in `linker.c'.

   These routines may simply be defined as macros.  For example, the
a.out backend linker hash table, which is derived from the linker hash
table, uses macros for the lookup and traversal routines.  These are
`aout_link_hash_lookup' and `aout_link_hash_traverse' in aoutx.h.

File: bfd.info,  Node: aout,  Next: coff,  Prev: What to Put Where,  Up: BFD back ends

3.2 a.out backends
==================

*Description*
BFD supports a number of different flavours of a.out format, though the
major differences are only the sizes of the structures on disk, and the
shape of the relocation information.

   The support is split into a basic support file `aoutx.h' and other
files which derive functions from the base. One derivation file is
`aoutf1.h' (for a.out flavour 1), and adds to the basic a.out functions
support for sun3, sun4, 386 and 29k a.out files, to create a target
jump vector for a specific target.

   This information is further split out into more specific files for
each machine, including `sunos.c' for sun3 and sun4, `newsos3.c' for
the Sony NEWS, and `demo64.c' for a demonstration of a 64 bit a.out
format.

   The base file `aoutx.h' defines general mechanisms for reading and
writing records to and from disk and various other methods which BFD
requires. It is included by `aout32.c' and `aout64.c' to form the names
`aout_32_swap_exec_header_in', `aout_64_swap_exec_header_in', etc.

   As an example, this is what goes on to make the back end for a sun4,
from `aout32.c':

            #define ARCH_SIZE 32
            #include "aoutx.h"

   Which exports names:

            ...
            aout_32_canonicalize_reloc
            aout_32_find_nearest_line
            aout_32_get_lineno
            aout_32_get_reloc_upper_bound
            ...

   from `sunos.c':

            #define TARGET_NAME "a.out-sunos-big"
            #define VECNAME    sunos_big_vec
            #include "aoutf1.h"

   requires all the names from `aout32.c', and produces the jump vector

            sunos_big_vec

   The file `host-aout.c' is a special case.  It is for a large set of
hosts that use "more or less standard" a.out files, and for which
cross-debugging is not interesting.  It uses the standard 32-bit a.out
support routines, but determines the file offsets and addresses of the
text, data, and BSS sections, the machine architecture and machine
type, and the entry point address, in a host-dependent manner.  Once
these values have been determined, generic code is used to handle the
object file.

   When porting it to run on a new system, you must supply:

             HOST_PAGE_SIZE
             HOST_SEGMENT_SIZE
             HOST_MACHINE_ARCH       (optional)
             HOST_MACHINE_MACHINE    (optional)
             HOST_TEXT_START_ADDR
             HOST_STACK_END_ADDR

   in the file `../include/sys/h-XXX.h' (for your host).  These values,
plus the structures and macros defined in `a.out.h' on your host
system, will produce a BFD target that will access ordinary a.out files
on your host. To configure a new machine to use `host-aout.c', specify:

            TDEFAULTS = -DDEFAULT_VECTOR=host_aout_big_vec
            TDEPFILES= host-aout.o trad-core.o

   in the `config/XXX.mt' file, and modify `configure.in' to use the
`XXX.mt' file (by setting "`bfd_target=XXX'") when your configuration
is selected.

3.2.1 Relocations
-----------------

*Description*
The file `aoutx.h' provides for both the _standard_ and _extended_
forms of a.out relocation records.

   The standard records contain only an address, a symbol index, and a
type field. The extended records (used on 29ks and sparcs) also have a
full integer for an addend.

3.2.2 Internal entry points
---------------------------

*Description*
`aoutx.h' exports several routines for accessing the contents of an

3.3 coff backends
=================

BFD supports a number of different flavours of coff format.  The major
differences between formats are the sizes and alignments of fields in
structures on disk, and the occasional extra field.

   Coff in all its varieties is implemented with a few common files and
a number of implementation specific files. For example, The 88k bcs
coff format is implemented in the file `coff-m88k.c'. This file
`#include's `coff/m88k.h' which defines the external structure of the
coff format for the 88k, and `coff/internal.h' which defines the
internal structure. `coff-m88k.c' also defines the relocations used by
the 88k format *Note Relocations::.

   The Intel i960 processor version of coff is implemented in
`coff-i960.c'. This file has the same structure as `coff-m88k.c',
except that it includes `coff/i960.h' rather than `coff-m88k.h'.

3.3.1 Porting to a new version of coff
--------------------------------------

The recommended method is to select from the existing implementations
the version of coff which is most like the one you want to use.  For
example, we'll say that i386 coff is the one you select, and that your
coff flavour is called foo.  Copy `i386coff.c' to `foocoff.c', copy
`../include/coff/i386.h' to `../include/coff/foo.h', and add the lines
to `targets.c' and `Makefile.in' so that your new back end is used.
Alter the shapes of the structures in `../include/coff/foo.h' so that
they match what you need. You will probably also have to add `#ifdef's
to the code in `coff/internal.h' and `coffcode.h' if your version of
coff is too wild.

   You can verify that your new BFD backend works quite simply by
building `objdump' from the `binutils' directory, and making sure that
its version of what's going on and your host system's idea (assuming it
has the pretty standard coff dump utility, usually called `att-dump' or
just `dump') are the same.  Then clean up your code, and send what
you've done to Cygnus. Then your stuff will be in the next release, and
you won't have to keep integrating it.

3.3.2 How the coff backend works
--------------------------------

3.3.2.1 File layout
...................

The Coff backend is split into generic routines that are applicable to
any Coff target and routines that are specific to a particular target.
The target-specific routines are further split into ones which are
basically the same for all Coff targets except that they use the
external symbol format or use different values for certain constants.

   The generic routines are in `coffgen.c'.  These routines work for
any Coff target.  They use some hooks into the target specific code;
the hooks are in a `bfd_coff_backend_data' structure, one of which
exists for each target.

   The essentially similar target-specific routines are in
`coffcode.h'.  This header file includes executable C code.  The
various Coff targets first include the appropriate Coff header file,
make any special defines that are needed, and then include `coffcode.h'.

   Some of the Coff targets then also have additional routines in the
target source file itself.

   For example, `coff-i960.c' includes `coff/internal.h' and
`coff/i960.h'.  It then defines a few constants, such as `I960', and
includes `coffcode.h'.  Since the i960 has complex relocation types,
`coff-i960.c' also includes some code to manipulate the i960 relocs.
This code is not in `coffcode.h' because it would not be used by any
other target.

3.3.2.2 Coff long section names
...............................

In the standard Coff object format, section names are limited to the
eight bytes available in the `s_name' field of the `SCNHDR' section
header structure.  The format requires the field to be NUL-padded, but
not necessarily NUL-terminated, so the longest section names permitted
are a full eight characters.

   The Microsoft PE variants of the Coff object file format add an
extension to support the use of long section names.  This extension is
defined in section 4 of the Microsoft PE/COFF specification (rev 8.1).
If a section name is too long to fit into the section header's `s_name'
field, it is instead placed into the string table, and the `s_name'
field is filled with a slash ("/") followed by the ASCII decimal
representation of the offset of the full name relative to the string
table base.

   Note that this implies that the extension can only be used in object
files, as executables do not contain a string table.  The standard
specifies that long section names from objects emitted into executable
images are to be truncated.

   However, as a GNU extension, BFD can generate executable images that
contain a string table and long section names.  This would appear to be
technically valid, as the standard only says that Coff debugging
information is deprecated, not forbidden, and in practice it works,
although some tools that parse PE files expecting the MS standard
format may become confused; `PEview' is one known example.

   The functionality is supported in BFD by code implemented under the
control of the macro `COFF_LONG_SECTION_NAMES'.  If not defined, the
format does not support long section names in any way.  If defined, it
is used to initialise a flag, `_bfd_coff_long_section_names', and a
hook function pointer, `_bfd_coff_set_long_section_names', in the Coff
backend data structure.  The flag controls the generation of long
section names in output BFDs at runtime; if it is false, as it will be
by default when generating an executable image, long section names are
truncated; if true, the long section names extension is employed.  The
hook points to a function that allows the value of the flag to be
altered at runtime, on formats that support long section names at all;
on other formats it points to a stub that returns an error indication.
With input BFDs, the flag is set according to whether any long section
names are detected while reading the section headers.  For a completely
new BFD, the flag is set to the default for the target format.  This
information can be used by a client of the BFD library when deciding
what output format to generate, and means that a BFD that is opened for
read and subsequently converted to a writeable BFD and modified
in-place will retain whatever format it had on input.

   If `COFF_LONG_SECTION_NAMES' is simply defined (blank), or is
defined to the value "1", then long section names are enabled by
default; if it is defined to the value zero, they are disabled by
default (but still accepted in input BFDs).  The header `coffcode.h'
defines a macro, `COFF_DEFAULT_LONG_SECTION_NAMES', which is used in
the backends to initialise the backend data structure fields
appropriately; see the comments for further detail.

3.3.2.3 Bit twiddling
.....................

Each flavour of coff supported in BFD has its own header file
describing the external layout of the structures. There is also an
internal description of the coff layout, in `coff/internal.h'. A major
function of the coff backend is swapping the bytes and twiddling the
bits to translate the external form of the structures into the normal
internal form. This is all performed in the `bfd_swap'_thing_direction
routines. Some elements are different sizes between different versions
of coff; it is the duty of the coff version specific include file to
override the definitions of various packing routines in `coffcode.h'.
E.g., the size of line number entry in coff is sometimes 16 bits, and
sometimes 32 bits. `#define'ing `PUT_LNSZ_LNNO' and `GET_LNSZ_LNNO'
will select the correct one. No doubt, some day someone will find a
version of coff which has a varying field size not catered to at the
moment. To port BFD, that person will have to add more `#defines'.
Three of the bit twiddling routines are exported to `gdb';
`coff_swap_aux_in', `coff_swap_sym_in' and `coff_swap_lineno_in'. `GDB'
reads the symbol table on its own, but uses BFD to fix things up.  More
of the bit twiddlers are exported for `gas'; `coff_swap_aux_out',
`coff_swap_sym_out', `coff_swap_lineno_out', `coff_swap_reloc_out',
`coff_swap_filehdr_out', `coff_swap_aouthdr_out',
`coff_swap_scnhdr_out'. `Gas' currently keeps track of all the symbol
table and reloc drudgery itself, thereby saving the internal BFD
overhead, but uses BFD to swap things on the way out, making cross
ports much safer.  Doing so also allows BFD (and thus the linker) to
use the same header files as `gas', which makes one avenue to disaster
disappear.

3.3.2.4 Symbol reading
......................

The simple canonical form for symbols used by BFD is not rich enough to
keep all the information available in a coff symbol table. The back end
gets around this problem by keeping the original symbol table around,
"behind the scenes".

   When a symbol table is requested (through a call to
`bfd_canonicalize_symtab'), a request gets through to
`coff_get_normalized_symtab'. This reads the symbol table from the coff
file and swaps all the structures inside into the internal form. It
also fixes up all the pointers in the table (represented in the file by
offsets from the first symbol in the table) into physical pointers to
elements in the new internal table. This involves some work since the
meanings of fields change depending upon context: a field that is a
pointer to another structure in the symbol table at one moment may be
the size in bytes of a structure at the next.  Another pass is made
over the table. All symbols which mark file names (`C_FILE' symbols)
are modified so that the internal string points to the value in the
auxent (the real filename) rather than the normal text associated with
the symbol (`".file"').

   At this time the symbol names are moved around. Coff stores all
symbols less than nine characters long physically within the symbol
table; longer strings are kept at the end of the file in the string
table. This pass moves all strings into memory and replaces them with
pointers to the strings.

   The symbol table is massaged once again, this time to create the
canonical table used by the BFD application. Each symbol is inspected
in turn, and a decision made (using the `sclass' field) about the
various flags to set in the `asymbol'.  *Note Symbols::. The generated
canonical table shares strings with the hidden internal symbol table.

   Any linenumbers are read from the coff file too, and attached to the
symbols which own the functions the linenumbers belong to.

3.3.2.5 Symbol writing
......................

Writing a symbol to a coff file which didn't come from a coff file will
lose any debugging information. The `asymbol' structure remembers the
BFD from which the symbol was taken, and on output the back end makes
sure that the same destination target as source target is present.

   When the symbols have come from a coff file then all the debugging
information is preserved.

   Symbol tables are provided for writing to the back end in a vector
of pointers to pointers. This allows applications like the linker to
accumulate and output large symbol tables without having to do too much
byte copying.

   This function runs through the provided symbol table and patches
each symbol marked as a file place holder (`C_FILE') to point to the
next file place holder in the list. It also marks each `offset' field
in the list with the offset from the first symbol of the current symbol.

   Another function of this procedure is to turn the canonical value
form of BFD into the form used by coff. Internally, BFD expects symbol
values to be offsets from a section base; so a symbol physically at
0x120, but in a section starting at 0x100, would have the value 0x20.
Coff expects symbols to contain their final value, so symbols have
their values changed at this point to reflect their sum with their
owning section.  This transformation uses the `output_section' field of
the `asymbol''s `asection' *Note Sections::.

   * `coff_mangle_symbols'
   This routine runs though the provided symbol table and uses the
offsets generated by the previous pass and the pointers generated when
the symbol table was read in to create the structured hierarchy
required by coff. It changes each pointer to a symbol into the index
into the symbol table of the asymbol.

   * `coff_write_symbols'
   This routine runs through the symbol table and patches up the
symbols from their internal form into the coff way, calls the bit
twiddlers, and writes out the table to the file.

3.3.2.6 `coff_symbol_type'
..........................

       unsigned int offset;

       /* Should the value of this symbol be renumbered.  Used for

       /* The container for the symbol structure as read and translated
          from the file. */
       union
       {
         union internal_auxent auxent;
         struct internal_syment syment;
       } u;
     } combined_entry_type;


     /* Each canonical asymbol really looks like this: */

     typedef struct coff_symbol_struct
     {
       /* The actual symbol which the rest of BFD works with */
       asymbol symbol;

       /* A pointer to the hidden information for this symbol */
       combined_entry_type *native;

       /* A pointer to the linenumber information for this symbol */
       struct lineno_cache_entry *lineno;

3.3.2.8 Writing relocations
...........................

To write relocations, the back end steps though the canonical
relocation table and create an `internal_reloc'. The symbol index to
use is removed from the `offset' field in the symbol table supplied.
The address comes directly from the sum of the section base address and
the relocation offset; the type is dug directly from the howto field.
Then the `internal_reloc' is swapped into the shape of an
`external_reloc' and written out to disk.

3.3.2.9 Reading linenumbers
...........................

Creating the linenumber table is done by reading in the entire coff
linenumber table, and creating another table for internal use.

   A coff linenumber table is structured so that each function is
marked as having a line number of 0. Each line within the function is
an offset from the first line in the function. The base of the line
number information for the table is stored in the symbol associated
with the function.

   Note: The PE format uses line number 0 for a flag indicating a new
source file.

   The information is copied from the external to the internal table,
and each symbol which marks a function is marked by pointing its...

   How does this work ?

3.3.2.10 Reading relocations
............................

Coff relocations are easily transformed into the internal BFD form
(`arelent').

   Reading a coff relocation table is done in the following stages:

   * Read the entire coff relocation table into memory.

   * Process each relocation in turn; first swap it from the external
     to the internal form.

   * Turn the symbol referenced in the relocation's symbol index into a
     pointer into the canonical symbol table.  This table is the same
     as the one returned by a call to `bfd_canonicalize_symtab'. The
     back end will call that routine and save the result if a
     canonicalization hasn't been done.

   * The reloc index is turned into a pointer to a howto structure, in
     a back end specific way. For instance, the 386 and 960 use the
     `r_type' to directly produce an index into a howto table vector;
     the 88k subtracts a number from the `r_type' field and creates an
     addend field.

3.4 ELF backends
================

BFD support for ELF formats is being worked on.  Currently, the best
supported back ends are for sparc and i386 (running svr4 or Solaris 2).

   Documentation of the internals of the support code still needs to be
written.  The code is changing quickly enough that we haven't bothered
yet.

3.5 mmo backend
===============

The mmo object format is used exclusively together with Professor
Donald E. Knuth's educational 64-bit processor MMIX.  The simulator
`mmix' which is available at
`http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs/mmix.tar.gz'
understands this format.  That package also includes a combined
assembler and linker called `mmixal'.  The mmo format has no advantages
feature-wise compared to e.g. ELF.  It is a simple non-relocatable
object format with no support for archives or debugging information,
except for symbol value information and line numbers (which is not yet
implemented in BFD).  See
`http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmix.html' for more
information about MMIX.  The ELF format is used for intermediate object
files in the BFD implementation.

File: bfd.info,  Node: File layout,  Next: Symbol-table,  Prev: mmo,  Up: mmo

3.5.1 File layout
-----------------

The mmo file contents is not partitioned into named sections as with
e.g. ELF.  Memory areas is formed by specifying the location of the
data that follows.  Only the memory area `0x0000...00' to `0x01ff...ff'
is executable, so it is used for code (and constants) and the area
`0x2000...00' to `0x20ff...ff' is used for writable data.  *Note mmo
section mapping::.

   There is provision for specifying "special data" of 65536 different
types.  We use type 80 (decimal), arbitrarily chosen the same as the
ELF `e_machine' number for MMIX, filling it with section information
normally found in ELF objects. *Note mmo section mapping::.

   Contents is entered as 32-bit words, xor:ed over previous contents,
always zero-initialized.  A word that starts with the byte `0x98' forms
a command called a `lopcode', where the next byte distinguished between
the thirteen lopcodes.  The two remaining bytes, called the `Y' and `Z'
fields, or the `YZ' field (a 16-bit big-endian number), are used for
various purposes different for each lopcode.  As documented in
`http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmixal-intro.ps.gz', the
lopcodes are:

`lop_quote'
     0x98000001.  The next word is contents, regardless of whether it
     starts with 0x98 or not.

`lop_loc'
     0x9801YYZZ, where `Z' is 1 or 2.  This is a location directive,
     setting the location for the next data to the next 32-bit word
     (for Z = 1) or 64-bit word (for Z = 2), plus Y * 2^56.  Normally
     `Y' is 0 for the text segment and 2 for the data segment.

`lop_skip'
     0x9802YYZZ.  Increase the current location by `YZ' bytes.

`lop_fixo'
     0x9803YYZZ, where `Z' is 1 or 2.  Store the current location as 64
     bits into the location pointed to by the next 32-bit (Z = 1) or
     64-bit (Z = 2) word, plus Y * 2^56.

`lop_fixr'
     0x9804YYZZ.  `YZ' is stored into the current location plus 2 - 4 *
     YZ.

`lop_fixrx'
     0x980500ZZ.  `Z' is 16 or 24.  A value `L' derived from the
     following 32-bit word are used in a manner similar to `YZ' in
     lop_fixr: it is xor:ed into the current location minus 4 * L.  The
     first byte of the word is 0 or 1.  If it is 1, then L = (LOWEST 24
     BITS OF WORD) - 2^Z, if 0, then L = (LOWEST 24 BITS OF WORD).

`lop_file'
     0x9806YYZZ.  `Y' is the file number, `Z' is count of 32-bit words.
     Set the file number to `Y' and the line counter to 0.  The next Z
     * 4 bytes contain the file name, padded with zeros if the count is
     not a multiple of four.  The same `Y' may occur multiple times,
     but `Z' must be 0 for all but the first occurrence.

`lop_line'
     0x9807YYZZ.  `YZ' is the line number.  Together with lop_file, it
     forms the source location for the next 32-bit word.  Note that for
     each non-lopcode 32-bit word, line numbers are assumed incremented
     by one.

`lop_spec'
     0x9808YYZZ.  `YZ' is the type number.  Data until the next lopcode
     other than lop_quote forms special data of type `YZ'.  *Note mmo
     section mapping::.

     Other types than 80, (or type 80 with a content that does not
     parse) is stored in sections named `.MMIX.spec_data.N' where N is
     the `YZ'-type.  The flags for such a sections say not to allocate
     or load the data.  The vma is 0.  Contents of multiple occurrences
     of special data N is concatenated to the data of the previous
     lop_spec Ns.  The location in data or code at which the lop_spec
     occurred is lost.

`lop_pre'
     0x980901ZZ.  The first lopcode in a file.  The `Z' field forms the
     length of header information in 32-bit words, where the first word
     tells the time in seconds since `00:00:00 GMT Jan 1 1970'.

`lop_post'
     0x980a00ZZ.  Z > 32.  This lopcode follows after all
     content-generating lopcodes in a program.  The `Z' field denotes
     the value of `rG' at the beginning of the program.  The following
     256 - Z big-endian 64-bit words are loaded into global registers
     `$G' ... `$255'.

`lop_stab'
     0x980b0000.  The next-to-last lopcode in a program.  Must follow
     immediately after the lop_post lopcode and its data.  After this
     lopcode follows all symbols in a compressed format (*note
     Symbol-table::).

`lop_end'
     0x980cYYZZ.  The last lopcode in a program.  It must follow the
     lop_stab lopcode and its data.  The `YZ' field contains the number
     of 32-bit words of symbol table information after the preceding
     lop_stab lopcode.

   Note that the lopcode "fixups"; `lop_fixr', `lop_fixrx' and
`lop_fixo' are not generated by BFD, but are handled.  They are
generated by `mmixal'.

   This trivial one-label, one-instruction file:

      :Main TRAP 1,2,3

   can be represented this way in mmo:

      0x98090101 - lop_pre, one 32-bit word with timestamp.
      <timestamp>
      0x98010002 - lop_loc, text segment, using a 64-bit address.
                   Note that mmixal does not emit this for the file above.
      0x00000000 - Address, high 32 bits.
      0x00000000 - Address, low 32 bits.
      0x98060002 - lop_file, 2 32-bit words for file-name.
      0x74657374 - "test"
      0x2e730000 - ".s\0\0"
      0x98070001 - lop_line, line 1.
      0x00010203 - TRAP 1,2,3
      0x980a00ff - lop_post, setting $255 to 0.
      0x00000000
      0x00000000
      0x980b0000 - lop_stab for ":Main" = 0, serial 1.
      0x203a4040   *Note Symbol-table::.
      0x10404020
      0x4d206120
      0x69016e00
      0x81000000
      0x980c0005 - lop_end; symbol table contained five 32-bit words.
