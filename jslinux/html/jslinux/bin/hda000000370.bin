assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all
the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.

.IP "\fB\-pass\-exit\-codes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pass-exit-codes"
Normally the \fBgcc\fR program will exit with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you specify
\&\fB\-pass\-exit\-codes\fR, the \fBgcc\fR program will instead return with
numerically highest error produced by any phase that returned an error
indication.  The C, \*(C+, and Fortran frontends return 4, if an internal
compiler error is encountered.
.PP
If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
\&\fB\-x\fR (or filename suffixes) to tell \fBgcc\fR where to start, and
one of the options \fB\-c\fR, \fB\-S\fR, or \fB\-E\fR to say where
\&\fBgcc\fR is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
\&\fB\-x cpp-output \-E\fR) instruct \fBgcc\fR to do nothing at all.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c"
Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an

.Sp
By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix \fB.c\fR, \fB.i\fR, \fB.s\fR, etc., with \fB.o\fR.
.Sp
Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o file"
Place output in file \fIfile\fR.  This applies regardless to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.
.Sp
If \fB\-o\fR is not specified, the default is to put an executable
file in \fIa.out\fR, the object file for
\&\fI\fIsource\fI.\fIsuffix\fI\fR in \fI\fIsource\fI.o\fR, its
assembler file in \fI\fIsource\fI.s\fR, a precompiled header file in
\&\fI\fIsource\fI.\fIsuffix\fI.gch\fR, and all preprocessed C source on
standard output.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v"
Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.
.IP "\fB\-###\fR" 4
.IX Item "-###"
Like \fB\-v\fR except the commands are not executed and all command
arguments are quoted.  This is useful for shell scripts to capture the
driver-generated command lines.
.IP "\fB\-pipe\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pipe"
Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the \s-1GNU\s0 assembler has
no trouble.
.IP "\fB\-combine\fR" 4
.IX Item "-combine"
If you are compiling multiple source files, this option tells the driver
to pass all the source files to the compiler at once (for those
languages for which the compiler can handle this).  This will allow
intermodule analysis (\s-1IMA\s0) to be performed by the compiler.  Currently the only
language for which this is supported is C.  If you pass source files for
multiple languages to the driver, using this option, the driver will invoke
the compiler(s) that support \s-1IMA\s0 once each, passing each compiler all the
source files appropriate for it.  For those languages that do not support
\&\s-1IMA\s0 this option will be ignored, and the compiler will be invoked once for
each source file in that language.  If you use this option in conjunction
with \fB\-save\-temps\fR, the compiler will generate multiple
pre-processed files
(one for each source file), but only one (combined) \fI.o\fR or
\&\fI.s\fR file.
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help"
Print (on the standard output) a description of the command line options
understood by \fBgcc\fR.  If the \fB\-v\fR option is also specified
then \fB\-\-help\fR will also be passed on to the various processes
invoked by \fBgcc\fR, so that they can display the command line options
they accept.  If the \fB\-Wextra\fR option has also been specified
(prior to the \fB\-\-help\fR option), then command line options which
have no documentation associated with them will also be displayed.
.IP "\fB\-\-target\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--target-help"
Print (on the standard output) a description of target-specific command
line options for each tool.  For some targets extra target-specific
information may also be printed.
.IP "\fB\-\-help=\fR\fIclass\fR[\fB,\fR\fIqualifier\fR]" 4
.IX Item "--help=class[,qualifier]"
Print (on the standard output) a description of the command line
options understood by the compiler that fit into a specific class.
The class can be one of \fBoptimizers\fR, \fBwarnings\fR, \fBtarget\fR,
\&\fBparams\fR, or \fIlanguage\fR:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBoptimizers\fR" 4
.IX Item "optimizers"
This will display all of the optimization options supported by the
compiler.
.IP "\fBwarnings\fR" 4
.IX Item "warnings"
This will display all of the options controlling warning messages
produced by the compiler.
.IP "\fBtarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "target"
This will display target-specific options.  Unlike the
\&\fB\-\-target\-help\fR option however, target-specific options of the
linker and assembler will not be displayed.  This is because those
tools do not currently support the extended \fB\-\-help=\fR syntax.
.IP "\fBparams\fR" 4
.IX Item "params"
This will display the values recognized by the \fB\-\-param\fR
option.
.IP "\fIlanguage\fR" 4
.IX Item "language"

\&\fIlanguage\fR is the name of one of the languages supported in this 
version of \s-1GCC\s0.
.IP "\fBcommon\fR" 4
.IX Item "common"
This will display the options that are common to all languages.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
It is possible to further refine the output of the \fB\-\-help=\fR
option by adding a comma separated list of qualifiers after the
class.  These can be any from the following list:
.IP "\fBundocumented\fR" 4
.IX Item "undocumented"
Display only those options which are undocumented.
.IP "\fBjoined\fR" 4
.IX Item "joined"
Display options which take an argument that appears after an equal
sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as:
\&\fB\-\-help=target\fR.
.IP "\fBseparate\fR" 4
.IX Item "separate"
Display options which take an argument that appears as a separate word
following the original option, such as: \fB\-o output-file\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Thus for example to display all the undocumented target-specific
switches supported by the compiler the following can be used:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-\-help=target,undocumented
.Ve
.Sp
The sense of a qualifier can be inverted by prefixing it with the
\&\fI^\fR character, so for example to display all binary warning
options (i.e., ones that are either on or off and that do not take an
argument), which have a description the following can be used:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-\-help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented
.Ve
.Sp
A class can also be used as a qualifier, although this usually
restricts the output by so much that there is nothing to display.  One
case where it does work however is when one of the classes is
\&\fItarget\fR.  So for example to display all the target-specific
optimization options the following can be used:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-\-help=target,optimizers
.Ve
.Sp
The \fB\-\-help=\fR option can be repeated on the command line.  Each
successive use will display its requested class of options, skipping
those that have already been displayed.
.Sp
If the \fB\-Q\fR option appears on the command line before the
\&\fB\-\-help=\fR option, then the descriptive text displayed by
\&\fB\-\-help=\fR is changed.  Instead of describing the displayed
options, an indication is given as to whether the option is enabled,
disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that the compiler
knows this at the point where the \fB\-\-help=\fR option is used).
.Sp
Here is a truncated example from the \s-1ARM\s0 port of \fBgcc\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&          % gcc \-Q \-mabi=2 \-\-help=target \-c
\&          The following options are target specific:
\&          \-mabi=                                2
\&          \-mabort\-on\-noreturn                   [disabled]
\&          \-mapcs                                [disabled]
.Ve
.Sp
The output is sensitive to the effects of previous command line
options, so for example it is possible to find out which optimizations
are enabled at \fB\-O2\fR by using:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-O2 \-\-help=optimizers
.Ve
.Sp
Alternatively you can discover which binary optimizations are enabled
by \fB\-O3\fR by using:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        gcc \-c \-Q \-O3 \-\-help=optimizers > /tmp/O3\-opts
\&        gcc \-c \-Q \-O2 \-\-help=optimizers > /tmp/O2\-opts
\&        diff /tmp/O2\-opts /tmp/O3\-opts | grep enabled

Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.
.Sh "Compiling \*(C+ Programs"
.IX Subsection "Compiling  Programs"
\&\*(C+ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes \fB.C\fR,
\&\fB.cc\fR, \fB.cpp\fR, \fB.CPP\fR, \fB.c++\fR, \fB.cp\fR, or
\&\fB.cxx\fR; \*(C+ header files often use \fB.hh\fR, \fB.hpp\fR,
\&\fB.H\fR, or (for shared template code) \fB.tcc\fR; and
preprocessed \*(C+ files use the suffix \fB.ii\fR.  \s-1GCC\s0 recognizes
files with these names and compiles them as \*(C+ programs even if you
call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually
with the name \fBgcc\fR).
.PP
However, the use of \fBgcc\fR does not add the \*(C+ library.
\&\fBg++\fR is a program that calls \s-1GCC\s0 and treats \fB.c\fR,
\&\fB.h\fR and \fB.i\fR files as \*(C+ source files instead of C source
files unless \fB\-x\fR is used, and automatically specifies linking
against the \*(C+ library.  This program is also useful when
precompiling a C header file with a \fB.h\fR extension for use in \*(C+
compilations.  On many systems, \fBg++\fR is also installed with
the name \fBc++\fR.
.PP
When you compile \*(C+ programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for \*(C+ programs.
.Sh "Options Controlling C Dialect"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling C Dialect"
The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as \*(C+, Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+) that the compiler
accepts:
.IP "\fB\-ansi\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ansi"
In C mode, this is equivalent to \fB\-std=c89\fR. In \*(C+ mode, it is
equivalent to \fB\-std=c++98\fR.
.Sp
This turns off certain features of \s-1GCC\s0 that are incompatible with \s-1ISO\s0
C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard \*(C+ (when compiling \*(C+ code),
such as the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR keywords, and
predefined macros such as \f(CW\*(C`unix\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`vax\*(C'\fR that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used \s-1ISO\s0 trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of \*(C+ style \fB//\fR comments as well as
the \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR keyword.
.Sp
The alternate keywords \f(CW\*(C`_\|_asm_\|_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_extension_\|_\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_inline_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_typeof_\|_\*(C'\fR continue to work despite
\&\fB\-ansi\fR.  You would not want to use them in an \s-1ISO\s0 C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with \fB\-ansi\fR.  Alternate predefined macros
such as \f(CW\*(C`_\|_unix_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_vax_\|_\*(C'\fR are also available, with or
without \fB\-ansi\fR.
.Sp
The \fB\-ansi\fR option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, \fB\-pedantic\fR is required in
addition to \fB\-ansi\fR.
.Sp
The macro \f(CW\*(C`_\|_STRICT_ANSI_\|_\*(C'\fR is predefined when the \fB\-ansi\fR
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
\&\s-1ISO\s0 standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.
.Sp
Functions that would normally be built in but do not have semantics
defined by \s-1ISO\s0 C (such as \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ffs\*(C'\fR) are not built-in
functions when \fB\-ansi\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-std=\fR" 4
.IX Item "-std="
Determine the language standard.   This option
is currently only supported when compiling C or \*(C+.
.Sp
The compiler can accept several base standards, such as \fBc89\fR or
\&\fBc++98\fR, and \s-1GNU\s0 dialects of those standards, such as
\&\fBgnu89\fR or \fBgnu++98\fR.  By specifing a base standard, the
compiler will accept all programs following that standard and those
using \s-1GNU\s0 extensions that do not contradict it.  For example,
\&\fB\-std=c89\fR turns off certain features of \s-1GCC\s0 that are
incompatible with \s-1ISO\s0 C90, such as the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR
keywords, but not other \s-1GNU\s0 extensions that do not have a meaning in
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C90, such as omitting the middle term of a \f(CW\*(C`?:\*(C'\fR
expression. On the other hand, by specifing a \s-1GNU\s0 dialect of a
standard, all features the compiler support are enabled, even when
those features change the meaning of the base standard and some
strict-conforming programs may be rejected.  The particular standard
is used by \fB\-pedantic\fR to identify which features are \s-1GNU\s0
extensions given that version of the standard. For example
\&\fB\-std=gnu89 \-pedantic\fR would warn about \*(C+ style \fB//\fR
comments, while \fB\-std=gnu99 \-pedantic\fR would not.

.IX Item "-fgnu89-inline"
The option \fB\-fgnu89\-inline\fR tells \s-1GCC\s0 to use the traditional
\&\s-1GNU\s0 semantics for \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR functions when in C99 mode.
  This option
is accepted and ignored by \s-1GCC\s0 versions 4.1.3 up to but not including
4.3.  In \s-1GCC\s0 versions 4.3 and later it changes the behavior of \s-1GCC\s0 in
C99 mode.  Using this option is roughly equivalent to adding the
\&\f(CW\*(C`gnu_inline\*(C'\fR function attribute to all inline functions.
.Sp
The option \fB\-fno\-gnu89\-inline\fR explicitly tells \s-1GCC\s0 to use the
C99 semantics for \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR when in C99 or gnu99 mode (i.e., it
specifies the default behavior).  This option was first supported in
\&\s-1GCC\s0 4.3.  This option is not supported in C89 or gnu89 mode.
.Sp
The preprocessor macros \f(CW\*(C`_\|_GNUC_GNU_INLINE_\|_\*(C'\fR and

.Sp
Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the origin of
each declaration (source file and line), whether the declaration was
implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (\fBI\fR, \fBN\fR for new or
\&\fBO\fR for old, respectively, in the first character after the line
number and the colon), and whether it came from a declaration or a
definition (\fBC\fR or \fBF\fR, respectively, in the following

arguments followed by their declarations is also provided, inside
comments, after the declaration.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-asm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-asm"
Do not recognize \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR as a
keyword, so that code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use
the keywords \f(CW\*(C`_\|_asm_\|_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_inline_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_typeof_\|_\*(C'\fR
instead.  \fB\-ansi\fR implies \fB\-fno\-asm\fR.
.Sp
In \*(C+, this switch only affects the \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR keyword, since
\&\f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR are standard keywords.  You may want to
use the \fB\-fno\-gnu\-keywords\fR flag instead, which has the same
effect.  In C99 mode (\fB\-std=c99\fR or \fB\-std=gnu99\fR), this
switch only affects the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR keywords, since

.PD
Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
\&\fB_\|_builtin_\fR as prefix.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR may become single
instructions that adjust the stack directly, and calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition,
when a function is recognized as a built-in function, \s-1GCC\s0 may use
information about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the
resulting code still contains calls to that function.  For example,
warnings are given with \fB\-Wformat\fR for bad calls to
\&\f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR, when \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR is built in, and \f(CW\*(C`strlen\*(C'\fR is
known not to modify global memory.
.Sp
With the \fB\-fno\-builtin\-\fR\fIfunction\fR option
only the built-in function \fIfunction\fR is
disabled.  \fIfunction\fR must not begin with \fB_\|_builtin_\fR.  If a
function is named this is not built-in in this version of \s-1GCC\s0, this
option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
\&\fB\-fbuiltin\-\fR\fIfunction\fR option; if you wish to enable
built-in functions selectively when using \fB\-fno\-builtin\fR or
\&\fB\-ffreestanding\fR, you may define macros such as:
.Sp
.Vb 2

Assert that compilation takes place in a freestanding environment.  This

.IX Item "-funsigned-char"
Let the type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR be unsigned, like \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Each kind of machine has a default for what \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR should
be.  It is either like \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR by default or like
\&\f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR by default.
.Sp
Ideally, a portable program should always use \f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use plain \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.
.Sp
The type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR is always a distinct type from each of
\&\f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.

These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the

default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR are signed types.
.Sh "Options Controlling \*(C+ Dialect"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling  Dialect"
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for \*(C+ programs; but you can also use most of the \s-1GNU\s0 compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file \f(CW\*(C`firstClass.C\*(C'\fR like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        g++ \-g \-frepo \-O \-c firstClass.C
.Ve
.PP
In this example, only \fB\-frepo\fR is an option meant
only for \*(C+ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by \s-1GCC\s0.
.PP
Here is a list of options that are \fIonly\fR for compiling \*(C+ programs:
.IP "\fB\-fabi\-version=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fabi-version=n"
Use version \fIn\fR of the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0.  Version 2 is the version of the
\&\*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 that first appeared in G++ 3.4.  Version 1 is the version of
the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 that first appeared in G++ 3.2.  Version 0 will always be
the version that conforms most closely to the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 specification.
Therefore, the \s-1ABI\s0 obtained using version 0 will change as \s-1ABI\s0 bugs
are fixed.
.Sp
The default is version 2.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-access\-control\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-access-control"
Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.
.IP "\fB\-fcheck\-new\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcheck-new"
Check that the pointer returned by \f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the \*(C+ standard specifies that
\&\f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR will only return \f(CW0\fR if it is declared
\&\fB\f(BIthrow()\fB\fR, in which case the compiler will always check the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
\&\f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing \f(CW\*(C`std::bad_alloc\*(C'\fR.  See also
\&\fBnew (nothrow)\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fconserve\-space\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fconserve-space"
Put uninitialized or runtime-initialized global variables into the
common segment, as C does.  This saves space in the executable at the
cost of not diagnosing duplicate definitions.  If you compile with this
flag and your program mysteriously crashes after \f(CW\*(C`main()\*(C'\fR has
completed, you may have an object that is being destroyed twice because
two definitions were merged.
.Sp
This option is no longer useful on most targets, now that support has
been added for putting variables into \s-1BSS\s0 without making them common.
.IP "\fB\-ffriend\-injection\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffriend-injection"
Inject friend functions into the enclosing namespace, so that they are
visible outside the scope of the class in which they are declared.
Friend functions were documented to work this way in the old Annotated
\&\*(C+ Reference Manual, and versions of G++ before 4.1 always worked
that way.  However, in \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ a friend function which is not declared
in an enclosing scope can only be found using argument dependent
lookup.  This option causes friends to be injected as they were in
earlier releases.
.Sp
This option is for compatibility, and may be removed in a future
release of G++.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-elide\-constructors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-elide-constructors"
The \*(C+ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
which is only used to initialize another object of the same type.
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-enforce\-eh\-specs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-enforce-eh-specs"
Don't generate code to check for violation of exception specifications
at runtime.  This option violates the \*(C+ standard, but may be useful
for reducing code size in production builds, much like defining
\&\fB\s-1NDEBUG\s0\fR.  This does not give user code permission to throw
exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler
will still optimize based on the specifications, so throwing an
unexpected exception will result in undefined behavior.
.IP "\fB\-ffor\-scope\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffor-scope"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-fno\-for\-scope\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-for-scope"
.PD
If \fB\-ffor\-scope\fR is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a \fIfor-init-statement\fR is limited to the \fBfor\fR loop itself,
as specified by the \*(C+ standard.
If \fB\-fno\-for\-scope\fR is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a \fIfor-init-statement\fR extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of G++, and other (traditional)
implementations of \*(C+.
.Sp
The default if neither flag is given to follow the standard,
but to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-gnu\-keywords\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-gnu-keywords"
Do not recognize \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR as a keyword, so that code can use this
word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword \f(CW\*(C`_\|_typeof_\|_\*(C'\fR instead.
\&\fB\-ansi\fR implies \fB\-fno\-gnu\-keywords\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-implicit\-templates\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-implicit-templates"
Never emit code for non-inline templates which are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-implicit\-inline\-templates\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-implicit-inline-templates"
Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either.
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and
without optimization will need the same set of explicit instantiations.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-implement\-inlines\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-implement-inlines"
To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by \fB#pragma implementation\fR.  This will cause linker

\&\f(CW\*(C`index\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bzero\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`conjf\*(C'\fR, and other related functions.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-operator\-names\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-operator-names"
Do not treat the operator name keywords \f(CW\*(C`and\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bitand\*(C'\fR,

synonyms as keywords.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-optional\-diags\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-optional-diags"
Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to

a name having multiple meanings within a class.
.IP "\fB\-fpermissive\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpermissive"
Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to
warnings.  Thus, using \fB\-fpermissive\fR will allow some
nonconforming code to compile.
.IP "\fB\-frepo\fR" 4

.IX Item "-fno-rtti"
Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the \*(C+ runtime type identification features
(\fBdynamic_cast\fR and \fBtypeid\fR).  If you don't use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but it will generate it as
needed. The \fBdynamic_cast\fR operator can still be used for casts that
do not require runtime type information, i.e. casts to \f(CW\*(C`void *\*(C'\fR or to
unambiguous base classes.
.IP "\fB\-fstats\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstats"
Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation.
This information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.
.IP "\fB\-ftemplate\-depth\-\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftemplate-depth-n"
Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to \fIn\fR.
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  \s-1ANSI/ISO\s0 \*(C+
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-threadsafe\-statics\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-threadsafe-statics"
Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the \*(C+
\&\s-1ABI\s0 for thread-safe initialization of local statics.  You can use this
option to reduce code size slightly in code that doesn't need to be
thread-safe.
.IP "\fB\-fuse\-cxa\-atexit\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fuse-cxa-atexit"
Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_atexit\*(C'\fR function rather than the \f(CW\*(C`atexit\*(C'\fR function.
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but will only work if your C library supports
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_atexit\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-use\-cxa\-get\-exception\-ptr\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr"
Don't use the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_get_exception_ptr\*(C'\fR runtime routine.  This
will cause \f(CW\*(C`std::uncaught_exception\*(C'\fR to be incorrect, but is necessary
if the runtime routine is not available.
.IP "\fB\-fvisibility\-inlines\-hidden\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvisibility-inlines-hidden"
This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
pointers to inline methods where the addresses of the two functions
were taken in different shared objects.
.Sp
The effect of this is that \s-1GCC\s0 may, effectively, mark inline methods with
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute_\|_ ((visibility ("hidden")))\*(C'\fR so that they do not
appear in the export table of a \s-1DSO\s0 and do not require a \s-1PLT\s0 indirection
when used within the \s-1DSO\s0.  Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect
on load and link times of a \s-1DSO\s0 as it massively reduces the size of the
dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of templates.
.Sp
The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static variables
local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce that
the function is defined in only one shared object.
.Sp
You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the
effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to
compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as
having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility will have no effect.
.Sp
Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option
as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library boundary.
.IP "\fB\-fvisibility\-ms\-compat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvisibility-ms-compat"
This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make \s-1GCC\s0's \*(C+
linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.
.Sp
The flag makes these changes to \s-1GCC\s0's linkage model:
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
It sets the default visibility to \f(CW\*(C`hidden\*(C'\fR, like
\&\fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR.
.IP "2." 4
Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.
.IP "3." 4
The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
visibility specifications which are defined in more than one different
shared object: those declarations are permitted if they would have
been permitted when this option was not used.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
In new code it is better to use \fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR and
export those classes which are intended to be externally visible.
Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely, perhaps accidentally,
on the Visual Studio behavior.
.Sp
Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members
of the same type with the same name but defined in different shared
objects will be different, so changing one will not change the other;
and that pointers to function members defined in different shared
objects may not compare equal.  When this flag is given, it is a
violation of the \s-1ODR\s0 to define types with the same name differently.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-fno\-weak\fR" 4

Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker.
By default, G++ will use weak symbols if they are available.  This

Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with the

In this case, G++ will place \f(CW\*(C`B::f2\*(C'\fR into the same byte
as\f(CW\*(C`A::f1\*(C'\fR; other compilers will not.  You can avoid this problem
by explicitly padding \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR so that its size is a multiple of the
byte size on your platform; that will cause G++ and other compilers to
layout \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR identically.

Incorrect handling of tail-padding for virtual bases.  G++ does not use
tail padding when laying out virtual bases.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        struct A { virtual void f(); char c1; };
\&        struct B { B(); char c2; };
\&        struct C : public A, public virtual B {};
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, G++ will not place \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR into the tail-padding for
\&\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR; other compilers will.  You can avoid this problem by
explicitly padding \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR so that its size is a multiple of its
alignment (ignoring virtual base classes); that will cause G++ and other
compilers to layout \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR identically.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Incorrect handling of bit-fields with declared widths greater than that
of their underlying types, when the bit-fields appear in a union.  For
example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        union U { int i : 4096; };
.Ve
.Sp
Assuming that an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR does not have 4096 bits, G++ will make the
union too small by the number of bits in an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Empty classes can be placed at incorrect offsets.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        struct A {};

\&          A a;
\&          virtual void f ();
\&        };
\&        
\&        struct C : public B, public A {};
.Ve
.Sp
G++ will place the \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR base class of \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR at a nonzero offset;
it should be placed at offset zero.  G++ mistakenly believes that the
\&\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR data member of \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR is already at offset zero.

Warn also about the use of an uncasted \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR as sentinel.  When
compiling only with \s-1GCC\s0 this is a valid sentinel, as \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR is defined

.IP "\fB\-Wno\-non\-template\-friend\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-non-template-friend ( and Objective- only)"
Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared
within a template.  Since the advent of explicit template specification
support in G++, if the name of the friend is an unqualified-id (i.e.,
\&\fBfriend foo(int)\fR), the \*(C+ language specification demands that the
friend declare or define an ordinary, nontemplate function.  (Section
14.5.3).  Before G++ implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids
could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
function.  Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the default
behavior for G++, \fB\-Wnon\-template\-friend\fR allows the compiler to
check existing code for potential trouble spots and is on by default.
This new compiler behavior can be turned off with

.IX Subsection "Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective- Dialects"
(\s-1NOTE:\s0 This manual does not describe the Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+
languages themselves.  See
.PP
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ programs, but you can also use most of
the language-independent \s-1GNU\s0 compiler options.
For example, you might compile a file \f(CW\*(C`some_class.m\*(C'\fR like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-g \-fgnu\-runtime \-O \-c some_class.m
.Ve
.PP
In this example, \fB\-fgnu\-runtime\fR is an option meant only for
Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ programs; you can use the other options with
any language supported by \s-1GCC\s0.
.PP
Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language, Objective-C
compilations may also use options specific to the C front-end (e.g.,
\&\fB\-Wtraditional\fR).  Similarly, Objective\-\*(C+ compilations may use
\&\*(C+\-specific options (e.g., \fB\-Wabi\fR).
.PP
Here is a list of options that are \fIonly\fR for compiling Objective-C
and Objective\-\*(C+ programs:
.IP "\fB\-fconstant\-string\-class=\fR\fIclass-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fconstant-string-class=class-name"
Use \fIclass-name\fR as the name of the class to instantiate for each
literal string specified with the syntax \f(CW\*(C`@"..."\*(C'\fR.  The default
class name is \f(CW\*(C`NXConstantString\*(C'\fR if the \s-1GNU\s0 runtime is being used, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`NSConstantString\*(C'\fR if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below).  The
\&\fB\-fconstant\-cfstrings\fR option, if also present, will override the
\&\fB\-fconstant\-string\-class\fR setting and cause \f(CW\*(C`@"..."\*(C'\fR literals
to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.
.IP "\fB\-fgnu\-runtime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgnu-runtime"
Generate object code compatible with the standard \s-1GNU\s0 Objective-C
runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.
.IP "\fB\-fnext\-runtime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fnext-runtime"
Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default
for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac \s-1OS\s0 X.  The macro
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_NEXT_RUNTIME_\|_\*(C'\fR is predefined if (and only if) this option is
used.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-nil\-receivers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-nil-receivers"
Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches (e.g.,
\&\f(CW\*(C`[receiver message:arg]\*(C'\fR) in this translation unit ensure that the receiver
is not \f(CW\*(C`nil\*(C'\fR.  This allows for more efficient entry points in the runtime
to be used.  Currently, this option is only available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS\s0 X 10.3 and later.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-call\-cxx\-cdtors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors"
For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables is a
\&\*(C+ object with a non-trivial default constructor.  If so, synthesize a
special \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR instance method that will run
non-trivial default constructors on any such instance variables, in order,
and then return \f(CW\*(C`self\*(C'\fR.  Similarly, check if any instance variable
is a \*(C+ object with a non-trivial destructor, and if so, synthesize a
special \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR method that will run
all such default destructors, in reverse order.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR and/or \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR methods
thusly generated will only operate on instance variables declared in the
current Objective-C class, and not those inherited from superclasses.  It
is the responsibility of the Objective-C runtime to invoke all such methods
in an object's inheritance hierarchy.  The \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR methods
will be invoked by the runtime immediately after a new object
instance is allocated; the \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR methods will
be invoked immediately before the runtime deallocates an object instance.
.Sp
As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS\s0 X 10.4 and later has
support for invoking the \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR methods.

The \f(CW@throw\fR statement may appear anywhere in an Objective-C or
Objective\-\*(C+ program; when used inside of a \f(CW@catch\fR block, the
\&\f(CW@throw\fR may appear without an argument (as shown above), in which case
the object caught by the \f(CW@catch\fR will be rethrown.
.Sp
Note that only (pointers to) Objective-C objects may be thrown and
caught using this scheme.  When an object is thrown, it will be caught
by the nearest \f(CW@catch\fR clause capable of handling objects of that type,
analogously to how \f(CW\*(C`catch\*(C'\fR blocks work in \*(C+ and Java.  A
\&\f(CW\*(C`@catch(id ...)\*(C'\fR clause (as shown above) may also be provided to catch
any and all Objective-C exceptions not caught by previous \f(CW@catch\fR
clauses (if any).
.Sp
The \f(CW@finally\fR clause, if present, will be executed upon exit from the
immediately preceding \f(CW\*(C`@try ... @catch\*(C'\fR section.  This will happen
regardless of whether any exceptions are thrown, caught or rethrown
inside the \f(CW\*(C`@try ... @catch\*(C'\fR section, analogously to the behavior
of the \f(CW\*(C`finally\*(C'\fR clause in Java.
.Sp
There are several caveats to using the new exception mechanism:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
Although currently designed to be binary compatible with \f(CW\*(C`NS_HANDLER\*(C'\fR\-style
idioms provided by the \f(CW\*(C`NSException\*(C'\fR class, the new
exceptions can only be used on Mac \s-1OS\s0 X 10.3 (Panther) and later
systems, due to additional functionality needed in the (NeXT) Objective-C
runtime.
.IP "\(bu" 4
As mentioned above, the new exceptions do not support handling
types other than Objective-C objects.   Furthermore, when used from
Objective\-\*(C+, the Objective-C exception model does not interoperate with \*(C+
exceptions at this time.  This means you cannot \f(CW@throw\fR an exception
from Objective-C and \f(CW\*(C`catch\*(C'\fR it in \*(C+, or vice versa
(i.e., \f(CW\*(C`throw ... @catch\*(C'\fR).
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The \fB\-fobjc\-exceptions\fR switch also enables the use of synchronization
blocks for thread-safe execution:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&          @synchronized (ObjCClass *guard) {
\&            ...
\&          }
.Ve
.Sp
Upon entering the \f(CW@synchronized\fR block, a thread of execution shall
first check whether a lock has been placed on the corresponding \f(CW\*(C`guard\*(C'\fR
object by another thread.  If it has, the current thread shall wait until
the other thread relinquishes its lock.  Once \f(CW\*(C`guard\*(C'\fR becomes available,
the current thread will place its own lock on it, execute the code contained in
the \f(CW@synchronized\fR block, and finally relinquish the lock (thereby
making \f(CW\*(C`guard\*(C'\fR available to other threads).
.Sp
Unlike Java, Objective-C does not allow for entire methods to be marked
\&\f(CW@synchronized\fR.  Note that throwing exceptions out of
\&\f(CW@synchronized\fR blocks is allowed, and will cause the guarding object
to be unlocked properly.

.IP "\fB\-fzero\-link\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fzero-link"
When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls
to \f(CW\*(C`objc_getClass("...")\*(C'\fR (when the name of the class is known at
compile time) with static class references that get initialized at load time,
which improves run-time performance.  Specifying the \fB\-fzero\-link\fR flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to \f(CW\*(C`objc_getClass("...")\*(C'\fR
to be retained.  This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during program execution.

If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for
every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The
default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass.  If you use the \fB\-Wno\-protocol\fR option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be implemented,

Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are
