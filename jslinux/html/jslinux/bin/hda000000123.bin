    call   __tls_get_addr, %tldm_call(symbol)
     nop

     sethi  %tldo_hix22(symbol), %l1
     xor    %l1, %tldo_lox10(symbol), %l1
     add    %o0, %l1, %l1, %tldo_add(symbol)

   Initial Exec:

     sethi  %tie_hi22(symbol), %l1
     add    %l1, %tie_lo10(symbol), %l1
     ld     [%l7 + %l1], %o0, %tie_ld(symbol)
     add    %g7, %o0, %o0, %tie_add(symbol)

     sethi  %tie_hi22(symbol), %l1
     add    %l1, %tie_lo10(symbol), %l1
     ldx    [%l7 + %l1], %o0, %tie_ldx(symbol)
     add    %g7, %o0, %o0, %tie_add(symbol)

   And finally, Local Exec:

     sethi  %tle_hix22(symbol), %l1
     add    %l1, %tle_lox10(symbol), %l1
     add    %g7, %l1, %l1

   When assembling for 64-bit, and a secondary constant addend is
specified in an address expression that would normally generate an
`R_SPARC_LO10' relocation, the assembler will emit an `R_SPARC_OLO10'
instead.

9.35.3.5 Size Translations
..........................

Often it is desirable to write code in an operand size agnostic manner.
`as' provides support for this via operand size opcode translations.
Translations are supported for loads, stores, shifts, compare-and-swap
atomics, and the `clr' synthetic instruction.

   If generating 32-bit code, `as' will generate the 32-bit opcode.
Whereas if 64-bit code is being generated, the 64-bit opcode will be
emitted.  For example `ldn' will be transformed into `ld' for 32-bit
code and `ldx' for 64-bit code.

   Here is an example meant to demonstrate all the supported opcode
translations:

     ldn   [%o0], %o1
     ldna  [%o0] %asi, %o2
     stn   %o1, [%o0]
     stna  %o2, [%o0] %asi
     slln  %o3, 3, %o3
     srln  %o4, 8, %o4
     sran  %o5, 12, %o5
     casn  [%o0], %o1, %o2
     casna [%o0] %asi, %o1, %o2
     clrn  %g1

   In 32-bit mode `as' will emit:

     ld   [%o0], %o1
     lda  [%o0] %asi, %o2
     st   %o1, [%o0]
     sta  %o2, [%o0] %asi
     sll  %o3, 3, %o3
     srl  %o4, 8, %o4
     sra  %o5, 12, %o5
     cas  [%o0], %o1, %o2
     casa [%o0] %asi, %o1, %o2
     clr  %g1

   And in 64-bit mode `as' will emit:

     ldx   [%o0], %o1
     ldxa  [%o0] %asi, %o2
     stx   %o1, [%o0]
     stxa  %o2, [%o0] %asi
     sllx  %o3, 3, %o3
     srlx  %o4, 8, %o4
     srax  %o5, 12, %o5
     casx  [%o0], %o1, %o2
     casxa [%o0] %asi, %o1, %o2
     clrx  %g1

   Finally, the `.nword' translating directive is supported as well.
It is documented in the section on Sparc machine directives.

9.35.4 Floating Point
---------------------

The Sparc uses IEEE floating-point numbers.


File: as.info,  Node: Sparc-Directives,  Prev: Sparc-Float,  Up: Sparc-Dependent

9.35.5 Sparc Machine Directives
-------------------------------

The Sparc version of `as' supports the following additional machine
directives:

`.align'
     This must be followed by the desired alignment in bytes.

`.common'
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     `"bss"'.  This behaves somewhat like `.comm', but the syntax is
     different.

`.half'
     This is functionally identical to `.short'.

`.nword'
     On the Sparc, the `.nword' directive produces native word sized
     value, ie. if assembling with -32 it is equivalent to `.word', if
     assembling with -64 it is equivalent to `.xword'.

`.proc'
     This directive is ignored.  Any text following it on the same line
     is also ignored.

`.register'
     This directive declares use of a global application or system
     register.  It must be followed by a register name %g2, %g3, %g6 or
     %g7, comma and the symbol name for that register.  If symbol name
     is `#scratch', it is a scratch register, if it is `#ignore', it
     just suppresses any errors about using undeclared global register,
     but does not emit any information about it into the object file.
     This can be useful e.g. if you save the register before use and
     restore it after.

`.reserve'
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     `"bss"'.  This behaves somewhat like `.lcomm', but the syntax is
     different.

`.seg'
     This must be followed by `"text"', `"data"', or `"data1"'.  It
     behaves like `.text', `.data', or `.data 1'.

`.skip'
     This is functionally identical to the `.space' directive.

`.word'
     On the Sparc, the `.word' directive produces 32 bit values,
     instead of the 16 bit values it produces on many other machines.

`.xword'
     On the Sparc V9 processor, the `.xword' directive produces 64 bit
     values.

9.36.1 Options
--------------

The TMS320C54X version of `as' has a few machine-dependent options.

   You can use the `-mfar-mode' option to enable extended addressing
mode.  All addresses will be assumed to be > 16 bits, and the
appropriate relocation types will be used.  This option is equivalent
to using the `.far_mode' directive in the assembly code.  If you do not
use the `-mfar-mode' option, all references will be assumed to be 16
bits.  This option may be abbreviated to `-mf'.

   You can use the `-mcpu' option to specify a particular CPU.  This
option is equivalent to using the `.version' directive in the assembly
code.  For recognized CPU codes, see *Note `.version':
TIC54X-Directives.  The default CPU version is `542'.

   You can use the `-merrors-to-file' option to redirect error output
to a file (this provided for those deficient environments which don't
provide adequate output redirection).  This option may be abbreviated to
`-me'.

9.36.2 Blocking
---------------

A blocked section or memory block is guaranteed not to cross the
blocking boundary (usually a page, or 128 words) if it is smaller than
the blocking size, or to start on a page boundary if it is larger than
the blocking size.

9.36.3 Environment Settings
---------------------------

`C54XDSP_DIR' and `A_DIR' are semicolon-separated paths which are added
to the list of directories normally searched for source and include
files.  `C54XDSP_DIR' will override `A_DIR'.

9.36.4 Constants Syntax
-----------------------

The TIC54X version of `as' allows the following additional constant
formats, using a suffix to indicate the radix:

     Binary                  `000000B, 011000b'
     Octal                   `10Q, 224q'
     Hexadecimal             `45h, 0FH'

9.36.5 String Substitution
--------------------------

A subset of allowable symbols (which we'll call subsyms) may be assigned
arbitrary string values.  This is roughly equivalent to C preprocessor
#define macros.  When `as' encounters one of these symbols, the symbol
is replaced in the input stream by its string value.  Subsym names
*must* begin with a letter.

   Subsyms may be defined using the `.asg' and `.eval' directives
(*Note `.asg': TIC54X-Directives, *Note `.eval': TIC54X-Directives.

   Expansion is recursive until a previously encountered symbol is
seen, at which point substitution stops.

   In this example, x is replaced with SYM2; SYM2 is replaced with
SYM1, and SYM1 is replaced with x.  At this point, x has already been
encountered and the substitution stops.

      .asg   "x",SYM1
      .asg   "SYM1",SYM2
      .asg   "SYM2",x
      add    x,a             ; final code assembled is "add  x, a"

   Macro parameters are converted to subsyms; a side effect of this is
the normal `as' '\ARG' dereferencing syntax is unnecessary.  Subsyms
defined within a macro will have global scope, unless the `.var'
directive is used to identify the subsym as a local macro variable
*note `.var': TIC54X-Directives.

   Substitution may be forced in situations where replacement might be
ambiguous by placing colons on either side of the subsym.  The following
code:

      .eval  "10",x
     LAB:X:  add     #x, a

   When assembled becomes:

     LAB10  add     #10, a

   Smaller parts of the string assigned to a subsym may be accessed with
the following syntax:

``:SYMBOL(CHAR_INDEX):''
     Evaluates to a single-character string, the character at
     CHAR_INDEX.

``:SYMBOL(START,LENGTH):''
     Evaluates to a substring of SYMBOL beginning at START with length
     LENGTH.

9.36.6 Local Labels
-------------------

Local labels may be defined in two ways:

   * $N, where N is a decimal number between 0 and 9

   * LABEL?, where LABEL is any legal symbol name.

   Local labels thus defined may be redefined or automatically
generated.  The scope of a local label is based on when it may be
undefined or reset.  This happens when one of the following situations
is encountered:

   * .newblock directive *note `.newblock': TIC54X-Directives.

   * The current section is changed (.sect, .text, or .data)

   * Entering or leaving an included file

   * The macro scope where the label was defined is exited

of a label or address.  For example, if an address `_label' resides in
extended program memory, the value of `_label' may be loaded as follows:
      ldx     #_label,16,a    ; loads extended bits of _label
      or      #_label,a       ; loads lower 16 bits of _label
      bacc    a               ; full address is in accumulator A

9.36.9 Directives
-----------------

`.align [SIZE]'
`.even'
     Align the section program counter on the next boundary, based on
     SIZE.  SIZE may be any power of 2.  `.even' is equivalent to
     `.align' with a SIZE of 2.
    `1'
          Align SPC to word boundary

    `2'
          Align SPC to longword boundary (same as .even)

    `128'
          Align SPC to page boundary

`.asg STRING, NAME'
     Assign NAME the string STRING.  String replacement is performed on
     STRING before assignment.

`.eval STRING, NAME'
     Evaluate the contents of string STRING and assign the result as a
     string to the subsym NAME.  String replacement is performed on
     STRING before assignment.

`.bss SYMBOL, SIZE [, [BLOCKING_FLAG] [,ALIGNMENT_FLAG]]'
     Reserve space for SYMBOL in the .bss section.  SIZE is in words.
     If present, BLOCKING_FLAG indicates the allocated space should be
     aligned on a page boundary if it would otherwise cross a page
     boundary.  If present, ALIGNMENT_FLAG causes the assembler to
     allocate SIZE on a long word boundary.

`.byte VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ubyte VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.char VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uchar VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place one or more bytes into consecutive words of the current
     section.  The upper 8 bits of each word is zero-filled.  If a
     label is used, it points to the word allocated for the first byte
     encountered.

`.clink ["SECTION_NAME"]'
     Set STYP_CLINK flag for this section, which indicates to the
     linker that if no symbols from this section are referenced, the
     section should not be included in the link.  If SECTION_NAME is
     omitted, the current section is used.

`.c_mode'
     TBD.

`.copy "FILENAME" | FILENAME'
`.include "FILENAME" | FILENAME'
     Read source statements from FILENAME.  The normal include search
     path is used.  Normally .copy will cause statements from the
     included file to be printed in the assembly listing and .include
     will not, but this distinction is not currently implemented.

`.data'
     Begin assembling code into the .data section.

`.double VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ldouble VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.float VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.xfloat VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place an IEEE single-precision floating-point representation of
     one or more floating-point values into the current section.  All
     but `.xfloat' align the result on a longword boundary.  Values are
     stored most-significant word first.

`.drlist'
`.drnolist'
     Control printing of directives to the listing file.  Ignored.

`.emsg STRING'
`.mmsg STRING'
`.wmsg STRING'
     Emit a user-defined error, message, or warning, respectively.

`.far_mode'
     Use extended addressing when assembling statements.  This should
     appear only once per file, and is equivalent to the -mfar-mode
     option *note `-mfar-mode': TIC54X-Opts.

`.fclist'
`.fcnolist'
     Control printing of false conditional blocks to the listing file.

`.field VALUE [,SIZE]'
     Initialize a bitfield of SIZE bits in the current section.  If
     VALUE is relocatable, then SIZE must be 16.  SIZE defaults to 16
     bits.  If VALUE does not fit into SIZE bits, the value will be
     truncated.  Successive `.field' directives will pack starting at
     the current word, filling the most significant bits first, and
     aligning to the start of the next word if the field size does not
     fit into the space remaining in the current word.  A `.align'
     directive with an operand of 1 will force the next `.field'
     directive to begin packing into a new word.  If a label is used, it
     points to the word that contains the specified field.

`.global SYMBOL [,...,SYMBOL_N]'
`.def SYMBOL [,...,SYMBOL_N]'
`.ref SYMBOL [,...,SYMBOL_N]'
     `.def' nominally identifies a symbol defined in the current file
     and available to other files.  `.ref' identifies a symbol used in
     the current file but defined elsewhere.  Both map to the standard
     `.global' directive.

`.half VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uhalf VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.short VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ushort VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.int VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uint VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.word VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uword VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place one or more values into consecutive words of the current
     section.  If a label is used, it points to the word allocated for
     the first value encountered.

`.label SYMBOL'
     Define a special SYMBOL to refer to the load time address of the
     current section program counter.

`.length'
`.width'
     Set the page length and width of the output listing file.  Ignored.

`.list'
`.nolist'
     Control whether the source listing is printed.  Ignored.

`.long VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ulong VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.xlong VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place one or more 32-bit values into consecutive words in the
     current section.  The most significant word is stored first.
     `.long' and `.ulong' align the result on a longword boundary;
     `xlong' does not.

`.loop [COUNT]'
`.break [CONDITION]'
`.endloop'
     Repeatedly assemble a block of code.  `.loop' begins the block, and
     `.endloop' marks its termination.  COUNT defaults to 1024, and
     indicates the number of times the block should be repeated.
     `.break' terminates the loop so that assembly begins after the
     `.endloop' directive.  The optional CONDITION will cause the loop
     to terminate only if it evaluates to zero.

`MACRO_NAME .macro [PARAM1][,...PARAM_N]'
`[.mexit]'
`.endm'
     See the section on macros for more explanation (*Note
     TIC54X-Macros::.

`.mlib "FILENAME" | FILENAME'
     Load the macro library FILENAME.  FILENAME must be an archived
     library (BFD ar-compatible) of text files, expected to contain
     only macro definitions.   The standard include search path is used.

`.mlist'
`.mnolist'
     Control whether to include macro and loop block expansions in the
     listing output.  Ignored.

`.mmregs'
     Define global symbolic names for the 'c54x registers.  Supposedly
     equivalent to executing `.set' directives for each register with
     its memory-mapped value, but in reality is provided only for
     compatibility and does nothing.

`.newblock'
     This directive resets any TIC54X local labels currently defined.
     Normal `as' local labels are unaffected.

`.option OPTION_LIST'
     Set listing options.  Ignored.

`.sblock "SECTION_NAME" | SECTION_NAME [,"NAME_N" | NAME_N]'
     Designate SECTION_NAME for blocking.  Blocking guarantees that a
     section will start on a page boundary (128 words) if it would
     otherwise cross a page boundary.  Only initialized sections may be
     designated with this directive.  See also *Note TIC54X-Block::.

`.sect "SECTION_NAME"'
     Define a named initialized section and make it the current section.

`SYMBOL .set "VALUE"'
`SYMBOL .equ "VALUE"'
     Equate a constant VALUE to a SYMBOL, which is placed in the symbol
     table.  SYMBOL may not be previously defined.

`.space SIZE_IN_BITS'
`.bes SIZE_IN_BITS'
     Reserve the given number of bits in the current section and
     zero-fill them.  If a label is used with `.space', it points to the
     *first* word reserved.  With `.bes', the label points to the
     *last* word reserved.

`.sslist'
`.ssnolist'
     Controls the inclusion of subsym replacement in the listing
     output.  Ignored.

`.string "STRING" [,...,"STRING_N"]'
`.pstring "STRING" [,...,"STRING_N"]'
     Place 8-bit characters from STRING into the current section.
     `.string' zero-fills the upper 8 bits of each word, while
     `.pstring' puts two characters into each word, filling the
     most-significant bits first.  Unused space is zero-filled.  If a
     label is used, it points to the first word initialized.

`[STAG] .struct [OFFSET]'
`[NAME_1] element [COUNT_1]'
`[NAME_2] element [COUNT_2]'
`[TNAME] .tag STAGX [TCOUNT]'
`...'
`[NAME_N] element [COUNT_N]'
`[SSIZE] .endstruct'
`LABEL .tag [STAG]'
     Assign symbolic offsets to the elements of a structure.  STAG
     defines a symbol to use to reference the structure.  OFFSET
     indicates a starting value to use for the first element
     encountered; otherwise it defaults to zero.  Each element can have
     a named offset, NAME, which is a symbol assigned the value of the
     element's offset into the structure.  If STAG is missing, these
     become global symbols.  COUNT adjusts the offset that many times,
     as if `element' were an array.  `element' may be one of `.byte',
     `.word', `.long', `.float', or any equivalent of those, and the
     structure offset is adjusted accordingly.  `.field' and `.string'
     are also allowed; the size of `.field' is one bit, and `.string'
     is considered to be one word in size.  Only element descriptors,
     structure/union tags, `.align' and conditional assembly directives
     are allowed within `.struct'/`.endstruct'.  `.align' aligns member
     offsets to word boundaries only.  SSIZE, if provided, will always
     be assigned the size of the structure.

     The `.tag' directive, in addition to being used to define a
     structure/union element within a structure, may be used to apply a
     structure to a symbol.  Once applied to LABEL, the individual
     structure elements may be applied to LABEL to produce the desired
     offsets using LABEL as the structure base.

`.tab'
     Set the tab size in the output listing.  Ignored.

`[UTAG] .union'
`[NAME_1] element [COUNT_1]'
`[NAME_2] element [COUNT_2]'
`[TNAME] .tag UTAGX[,TCOUNT]'
`...'
`[NAME_N] element [COUNT_N]'
`[USIZE] .endstruct'
`LABEL .tag [UTAG]'
     Similar to `.struct', but the offset after each element is reset to
     zero, and the USIZE is set to the maximum of all defined elements.
     Starting offset for the union is always zero.

`[SYMBOL] .usect "SECTION_NAME", SIZE, [,[BLOCKING_FLAG] [,ALIGNMENT_FLAG]]'
     Reserve space for variables in a named, uninitialized section
     (similar to .bss).  `.usect' allows definitions sections
     independent of .bss.  SYMBOL points to the first location reserved
     by this allocation.  The symbol may be used as a variable name.
     SIZE is the allocated size in words.  BLOCKING_FLAG indicates
     whether to block this section on a page boundary (128 words)
     (*note TIC54X-Block::).  ALIGNMENT FLAG indicates whether the
     section should be longword-aligned.

`.var SYM[,..., SYM_N]'
     Define a subsym to be a local variable within a macro.  See *Note
     TIC54X-Macros::.

`.version VERSION'
     Set which processor to build instructions for.  Though the
     following values are accepted, the op is ignored.
    `541'
    `542'
    `543'
    `545'
    `545LP'
    `546LP'

9.36.10 Macros
--------------

Macros do not require explicit dereferencing of arguments (i.e., \ARG).

   During macro expansion, the macro parameters are converted to
subsyms.  If the number of arguments passed the macro invocation
exceeds the number of parameters defined, the last parameter is
assigned the string equivalent of all remaining arguments.  If fewer
arguments are given than parameters, the missing parameters are
assigned empty strings.  To include a comma in an argument, you must
enclose the argument in quotes.

   The following built-in subsym functions allow examination of the
string value of subsyms (or ordinary strings).  The arguments are
strings unless otherwise indicated (subsyms passed as args will be
replaced by the strings they represent).
``$symlen(STR)''
     Returns the length of STR.

``$symcmp(STR1,STR2)''
     Returns 0 if STR1 == STR2, non-zero otherwise.

``$firstch(STR,CH)''
     Returns index of the first occurrence of character constant CH in
     STR.

``$lastch(STR,CH)''
     Returns index of the last occurrence of character constant CH in
     STR.

``$isdefed(SYMBOL)''
     Returns zero if the symbol SYMBOL is not in the symbol table,
     non-zero otherwise.

``$ismember(SYMBOL,LIST)''
     Assign the first member of comma-separated string LIST to SYMBOL;
     LIST is reassigned the remainder of the list.  Returns zero if
     LIST is a null string.  Both arguments must be subsyms.

``$iscons(EXPR)''
     Returns 1 if string EXPR is binary, 2 if octal, 3 if hexadecimal,
     4 if a character, 5 if decimal, and zero if not an integer.

``$isname(NAME)''
     Returns 1 if NAME is a valid symbol name, zero otherwise.

``$isreg(REG)''
     Returns 1 if REG is a valid predefined register name (AR0-AR7
     only).

``$structsz(STAG)''
     Returns the size of the structure or union represented by STAG.

``$structacc(STAG)''
     Returns the reference point of the structure or union represented
     by STAG.   Always returns zero.

* TIC6X Syntax::             Syntax
* TIC6X Directives::         Directives


File: as.info,  Node: TIC6X Options,  Next: TIC6X Syntax,  Up: TIC6X-Dependent

9.37.1 TIC6X Options
--------------------

`-march=ARCH'
     Enable (only) instructions from architecture ARCH.  By default,
     all instructions are permitted.

     The following values of ARCH are accepted: `c62x', `c64x',
     `c64x+', `c67x', `c67x+', `c674x'.

`-matomic'
`-mno-atomic'
     Enable or disable the optional C64x+ atomic operation instructions.
     By default, they are enabled if no `-march' option is given, or if
     an architecture is specified with `-march' that implies these
     instructions are present (currently, there are no such
     architectures); they are disabled if an architecture is specified
     with `-march' on which the instructions are optional or not
     present.  This option overrides such a default from the
     architecture, independent of the order in which the `-march' or
     `-matomic' or `-mno-atomic' options are passed.

`-mdsbt'
`-mno-dsbt'
     The `-mdsbt' option causes the assembler to generate the
     `Tag_ABI_DSBT' attribute with a value of 1, indicating that the
     code is using DSBT addressing.  The `-mno-dsbt' option, the
     default, causes the tag to have a value of 0, indicating that the
     code does not use DSBT addressing.  The linker will emit a warning
     if objects of different type (DSBT and non-DSBT) are linked
     together.

`-mpid=no'
`-mpid=near'
`-mpid=far'
     The `-mpid=' option causes the assembler to generate the
     `Tag_ABI_PID' attribute with a value indicating the form of data
     addressing used by the code.  `-mpid=no', the default, indicates
     position-dependent data addressing, `-mpid=near' indicates
     position-independent addressing with GOT accesses using near DP
     addressing, and `-mpid=far' indicates position-independent
     addressing with GOT accesses using far DP addressing.  The linker
     will emit a warning if objects built with different settings of
     this option are linked together.

`-mpic'
`-mno-pic'
     The `-mpic' option causes the assembler to generate the
     `Tag_ABI_PIC' attribute with a value of 1, indicating that the
     code is using position-independent code addressing,  The
     `-mno-pic' option, the default, causes the tag to have a value of
     0, indicating position-dependent code addressing.  The linker will
     emit a warning if objects of different type (position-dependent and
     position-independent) are linked together.

`-mbig-endian'
`-mlittle-endian'
     Generate code for the specified endianness.  The default is
     little-endian.

9.37.2 TIC6X Syntax
-------------------

The presence of a `;' on a line indicates the start of a comment that
extends to the end of the current line.  If a `#' or `*' appears as the
first character of a line, the whole line is treated as a comment.

   The `@' character can be used instead of a newline to separate
statements.

   Instruction, register and functional unit names are case-insensitive.
`as' requires fully-specified functional unit names, such as `.S1',
`.L1X' or `.D1T2', on all instructions using a functional unit.

   For some instructions, there may be syntactic ambiguity between
register or functional unit names and the names of labels or other
symbols.  To avoid this, enclose the ambiguous symbol name in
parentheses; register and functional unit names may not be enclosed in
parentheses.

9.37.3 TIC6X Directives
-----------------------

Directives controlling the set of instructions accepted by the
assembler have effect for instructions between the directive and any
subsequent directive overriding it.

`.arch ARCH'
     This has the same effect as `-march=ARCH'.

`.atomic'
`.noatomic'
     These have the same effects as `-matomic' and `-mno-atomic'.

`.c6xabi_attribute TAG, VALUE'
     Set the C6000 EABI build attribute TAG to VALUE.

     The TAG is either an attribute number or one of `Tag_ISA',
     `Tag_ABI_wchar_t', `Tag_ABI_stack_align_needed',
     `Tag_ABI_stack_align_preserved', `Tag_ABI_DSBT', `Tag_ABI_PID',
     `Tag_ABI_PIC', `TAG_ABI_array_object_alignment',
     `TAG_ABI_array_object_align_expected', `Tag_ABI_compatibility' and
     `Tag_ABI_conformance'.  The VALUE is either a `number',
     `"string"', or `number, "string"' depending on the tag.

`.nocmp'
     Disallow use of C64x+ compact instructions in the current text
     section.

9.38.1 Options
--------------

The Zilog Z80 and Ascii R800 version of `as' have a few machine
dependent options.
`-z80'
     Produce code for the Z80 processor. There are additional options to
     request warnings and error messages for undocumented instructions.

`-ignore-undocumented-instructions'
`-Wnud'
     Silently assemble undocumented Z80-instructions that have been
     adopted as documented R800-instructions.

`-ignore-unportable-instructions'
`-Wnup'
     Silently assemble all undocumented Z80-instructions.

`-warn-undocumented-instructions'
`-Wud'
     Issue warnings for undocumented Z80-instructions that work on
     R800, do not assemble other undocumented instructions without
     warning.

`-warn-unportable-instructions'
`-Wup'
     Issue warnings for other undocumented Z80-instructions, do not
     treat any undocumented instructions as errors.

`-forbid-undocumented-instructions'
`-Fud'
     Treat all undocumented z80-instructions as errors.

`-forbid-unportable-instructions'
`-Fup'
     Treat undocumented z80-instructions that do not work on R800 as
     errors.

`-r800'
     Produce code for the R800 processor. The assembler does not support
     undocumented instructions for the R800.  In line with common
     practice, `as' uses Z80 instruction names for the R800 processor,
     as far as they exist.

9.38.2 Syntax
-------------

The assembler syntax closely follows the 'Z80 family CPU User Manual' by
Zilog.  In expressions a single `=' may be used as "is equal to"
comparison operator.

   Suffices can be used to indicate the radix of integer constants; `H'
or `h' for hexadecimal, `D' or `d' for decimal, `Q', `O', `q' or `o'
for octal, and `B' for binary.

   The suffix `b' denotes a backreference to local label.

File: as.info,  Node: Z80-Chars,  Next: Z80-Regs,  Up: Z80 Syntax

9.38.2.1 Special Characters
...........................

The semicolon `;' is the line comment character;

   The dollar sign `$' can be used as a prefix for hexadecimal numbers
and as a symbol denoting the current location counter.

   A backslash `\' is an ordinary character for the Z80 assembler.

   The single quote `'' must be followed by a closing quote. If there
is one character in between, it is a character constant, otherwise it is
a string constant.

9.38.2.2 Register Names
.......................

The registers are referred to with the letters assigned to them by
Zilog. In addition `as' recognizes `ixl' and `ixh' as the least and
most significant octet in `ix', and similarly `iyl' and  `iyh' as parts
of `iy'.


File: as.info,  Node: Z80-Case,  Prev: Z80-Regs,  Up: Z80 Syntax

9.38.2.3 Case Sensitivity
.........................

Upper and lower case are equivalent in register names, opcodes,
condition codes  and assembler directives.  The case of letters is
significant in labels and symbol names. The case is also important to
distinguish the suffix `b' for a backward reference to a local label
from the suffix `B' for a number in binary notation.

9.38.4 Z80 Assembler Directives
-------------------------------

`as' for the Z80 supports some additional directives for compatibility
with other assemblers.

   These are the additional directives in `as' for the Z80:

`db EXPRESSION|STRING[,EXPRESSION|STRING...]'
`defb EXPRESSION|STRING[,EXPRESSION|STRING...]'
     For each STRING the characters are copied to the object file, for
     each other EXPRESSION the value is stored in one byte.  A warning
     is issued in case of an overflow.

`dw EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
`defw EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
     For each EXPRESSION the value is stored in two bytes, ignoring
     overflow.

`d24 EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
`def24 EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
     For each EXPRESSION the value is stored in three bytes, ignoring
     overflow.

`d32 EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
`def32 EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
     For each EXPRESSION the value is stored in four bytes, ignoring
     overflow.

`ds COUNT[, VALUE]'
`defs COUNT[, VALUE]'
     Fill COUNT bytes in the object file with VALUE, if VALUE is
     omitted it defaults to zero.

`SYMBOL equ EXPRESSION'
`SYMBOL defl EXPRESSION'
     These directives set the value of SYMBOL to EXPRESSION. If `equ'
     is used, it is an error if SYMBOL is already defined.  Symbols
     defined with `equ' are not protected from redefinition.

`set'
     This is a normal instruction on Z80, and not an assembler
     directive.

`psect NAME'
     A synonym for *Note Section::, no second argument should be given.



File: as.info,  Node: Z80 Opcodes,  Prev: Z80 Directives,  Up: Z80-Dependent

9.38.5 Opcodes
--------------

In line with common practice, Z80 mnemonics are used for both the Z80
and the R800.

   In many instructions it is possible to use one of the half index
registers (`ixl',`ixh',`iyl',`iyh') in stead of an 8-bit general
purpose register. This yields instructions that are documented on the
R800 and undocumented on the Z80.  Similarly `in f,(c)' is documented
on the R800 and undocumented on the Z80.

   The assembler also supports the following undocumented
Z80-instructions, that have not been adopted in the R800 instruction
set:
`out (c),0'
     Sends zero to the port pointed to by register c.

`sli M'
     Equivalent to `M = (M<<1)+1', the operand M can be any operand
     that is valid for `sla'. One can use `sll' as a synonym for `sli'.

`OP (ix+D), R'
     This is equivalent to

          ld R, (ix+D)
          OPC R
          ld (ix+D), R

     The operation `OPC' may be any of `res B,', `set B,', `rl', `rlc',
     `rr', `rrc', `sla', `sli', `sra' and `srl', and the register `R'
     may be any of `a', `b', `c', `d', `e', `h' and `l'.

`OPC (iy+D), R'
     As above, but with `iy' instead of `ix'.

   The web site at `http://www.z80.info' is a good starting place to
find more information on programming the Z80.

9.39 Z8000 Dependent Features
=============================

   The Z8000 as supports both members of the Z8000 family: the
unsegmented Z8002, with 16 bit addresses, and the segmented Z8001 with
24 bit addresses.

   When the assembler is in unsegmented mode (specified with the
`unsegm' directive), an address takes up one word (16 bit) sized
register.  When the assembler is in segmented mode (specified with the
`segm' directive), a 24-bit address takes up a long (32 bit) register.

9.39.2.3 Addressing Modes
.........................

as understands the following addressing modes for the Z8000:

`rlN'
`rhN'
`rN'
`rrN'
`rqN'
     Register direct:  8bit, 16bit, 32bit, and 64bit registers.

`@rN'
`@rrN'
     Indirect register:  @rrN in segmented mode, @rN in unsegmented
     mode.

`ADDR'
     Direct: the 16 bit or 24 bit address (depending on whether the
     assembler is in segmented or unsegmented mode) of the operand is
     in the instruction.

`address(rN)'
     Indexed: the 16 or 24 bit address is added to the 16 bit register
     to produce the final address in memory of the operand.

`rN(#IMM)'
`rrN(#IMM)'
     Base Address: the 16 or 24 bit register is added to the 16 bit sign
     extended immediate displacement to produce the final address in
     memory of the operand.

`rN(rM)'
`rrN(rM)'
     Base Index: the 16 or 24 bit register rN or rrN is added to the
     sign extended 16 bit index register rM to produce the final
     address in memory of the operand.

`#XX'
     Immediate data XX.

9.39.3 Assembler Directives for the Z8000
-----------------------------------------

The Z8000 port of as includes additional assembler directives, for
compatibility with other Z8000 assemblers.  These do not begin with `.'
(unlike the ordinary as directives).

`segm'
`.z8001'
     Generate code for the segmented Z8001.

`unsegm'
`.z8002'
     Generate code for the unsegmented Z8002.

`name'
     Synonym for `.file'

`global'
     Synonym for `.global'

`wval'
     Synonym for `.word'

`lval'
     Synonym for `.long'

`bval'
     Synonym for `.byte'

`sval'
     Assemble a string.  `sval' expects one string literal, delimited by
     single quotes.  It assembles each byte of the string into
     consecutive addresses.  You can use the escape sequence `%XX'
     (where XX represents a two-digit hexadecimal number) to represent
     the character whose ASCII value is XX.  Use this feature to
     describe single quote and other characters that may not appear in
     string literals as themselves.  For example, the C statement
     `char *a = "he said \"it's 50% off\"";' is represented in Z8000
     assembly language (shown with the assembler output in hex at the
     left) as

          68652073    sval    'he said %22it%27s 50%25 off%22%00'

          73203530
          25206F66
          662200

`rsect'
     synonym for `.section'

`block'
     synonym for `.space'

`even'
     special case of `.align'; aligns output to even byte boundary.

File: as.info,  Node: VAX-Opts,  Next: VAX-float,  Up: Vax-Dependent

9.40.1 VAX Command-Line Options
-------------------------------

The Vax version of `as' accepts any of the following options, gives a
warning message that the option was ignored and proceeds.  These
options are for compatibility with scripts designed for other people's
assemblers.

``-D' (Debug)'
``-S' (Symbol Table)'
``-T' (Token Trace)'
     These are obsolete options used to debug old assemblers.

``-d' (Displacement size for JUMPs)'
     This option expects a number following the `-d'.  Like options
     that expect filenames, the number may immediately follow the `-d'
     (old standard) or constitute the whole of the command line
     argument that follows `-d' (GNU standard).

``-V' (Virtualize Interpass Temporary File)'
     Some other assemblers use a temporary file.  This option commanded
     them to keep the information in active memory rather than in a
     disk file.  `as' always does this, so this option is redundant.

``-J' (JUMPify Longer Branches)'
     Many 32-bit computers permit a variety of branch instructions to
     do the same job.  Some of these instructions are short (and fast)
     but have a limited range; others are long (and slow) but can
     branch anywhere in virtual memory.  Often there are 3 flavors of
     branch: short, medium and long.  Some other assemblers would emit
     short and medium branches, unless told by this option to emit
     short and long branches.

``-t' (Temporary File Directory)'
     Some other assemblers may use a temporary file, and this option
     takes a filename being the directory to site the temporary file.
     Since `as' does not use a temporary disk file, this option makes
     no difference.  `-t' needs exactly one filename.

   The Vax version of the assembler accepts additional options when
compiled for VMS:

`-h N'
     External symbol or section (used for global variables) names are
     not case sensitive on VAX/VMS and always mapped to upper case.
     This is contrary to the C language definition which explicitly
     distinguishes upper and lower case.  To implement a standard
     conforming C compiler, names must be changed (mapped) to preserve
     the case information.  The default mapping is to convert all lower
     case characters to uppercase and adding an underscore followed by
     a 6 digit hex value, representing a 24 digit binary value.  The
     one digits in the binary value represent which characters are
     uppercase in the original symbol name.

     The `-h N' option determines how we map names.  This takes several
     values.  No `-h' switch at all allows case hacking as described
     above.  A value of zero (`-h0') implies names should be upper
     case, and inhibits the case hack.  A value of 2 (`-h2') implies
     names should be all lower case, with no case hack.  A value of 3
     (`-h3') implies that case should be preserved.  The value 1 is
     unused.  The `-H' option directs `as' to display every mapped
     symbol during assembly.

     Symbols whose names include a dollar sign `$' are exceptions to the
     general name mapping.  These symbols are normally only used to
     reference VMS library names.  Such symbols are always mapped to
     upper case.

`-+'
     The `-+' option causes `as' to truncate any symbol name larger
     than 31 characters.  The `-+' option also prevents some code
     following the `_main' symbol normally added to make the object
     file compatible with Vax-11 "C".

`-1'
     This option is ignored for backward compatibility with `as'
     version 1.x.

`-H'
     The `-H' option causes `as' to print every symbol which was
     changed by case mapping.

9.40.2 VAX Floating Point
-------------------------

Conversion of flonums to floating point is correct, and compatible with
previous assemblers.  Rounding is towards zero if the remainder is
exactly half the least significant bit.

   `D', `F', `G' and `H' floating point formats are understood.

   Immediate floating literals (_e.g._ `S`$6.9') are rendered
correctly.  Again, rounding is towards zero in the boundary case.

   The `.float' directive produces `f' format numbers.  The `.double'
directive produces `d' format numbers.

9.40.3 Vax Machine Directives
-----------------------------

The Vax version of the assembler supports four directives for
generating Vax floating point constants.  They are described in the
table below.

`.dfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `d' format 64-bit floating point constants.

`.ffloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `f' format 32-bit floating point constants.

`.gfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `g' format 64-bit floating point constants.

`.hfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `h' format 128-bit floating point constants.

9.40.4 VAX Opcodes
------------------

All DEC mnemonics are supported.  Beware that `case...' instructions
have exactly 3 operands.  The dispatch table that follows the `case...'
instruction should be made with `.word' statements.  This is compatible
with all unix assemblers we know of.

9.40.5 VAX Branch Improvement
-----------------------------

Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted.  They are for branch
instructions.  They expand to the shortest branch instruction that
reaches the target.  Generally these mnemonics are made by substituting
`j' for `b' at the start of a DEC mnemonic.  This feature is included
both for compatibility and to help compilers.  If you do not need this
feature, avoid these opcodes.  Here are the mnemonics, and the code
they can expand into.

`jbsb'
     `Jsb' is already an instruction mnemonic, so we chose `jbsb'.
    (byte displacement)
          `bsbb ...'

    (word displacement)
          `bsbw ...'

    (long displacement)
          `jsb ...'

`jbr'
`jr'
     Unconditional branch.
    (byte displacement)
          `brb ...'

    (word displacement)
          `brw ...'

    (long displacement)
          `jmp ...'

`jCOND'
     COND may be any one of the conditional branches `neq', `nequ',
     `eql', `eqlu', `gtr', `geq', `lss', `gtru', `lequ', `vc', `vs',
     `gequ', `cc', `lssu', `cs'.  COND may also be one of the bit tests
     `bs', `bc', `bss', `bcs', `bsc', `bcc', `bssi', `bcci', `lbs',
     `lbc'.  NOTCOND is the opposite condition to COND.
    (byte displacement)
          `bCOND ...'

    (word displacement)
          `bNOTCOND foo ; brw ... ; foo:'

    (long displacement)
          `bNOTCOND foo ; jmp ... ; foo:'

`jacbX'
     X may be one of `b d f g h l w'.
    (word displacement)
          `OPCODE ...'

    (long displacement)
               OPCODE ..., foo ;
               brb bar ;
               foo: jmp ... ;
               bar:

`jaobYYY'
     YYY may be one of `lss leq'.

`jsobZZZ'
     ZZZ may be one of `geq gtr'.
    (byte displacement)
          `OPCODE ...'

    (word displacement)
               OPCODE ..., foo ;
               brb bar ;
               foo: brw DESTINATION ;
               bar:

    (long displacement)
               OPCODE ..., foo ;
               brb bar ;
               foo: jmp DESTINATION ;
               bar:

`aobleq'
`aoblss'
`sobgeq'
`sobgtr'

    (byte displacement)
          `OPCODE ...'

    (word displacement)
               OPCODE ..., foo ;
               brb bar ;
               foo: brw DESTINATION ;
               bar:

    (long displacement)
               OPCODE ..., foo ;
               brb bar ;
               foo: jmp DESTINATION ;
               bar:

9.40.6 VAX Operands
-------------------

The immediate character is `$' for Unix compatibility, not `#' as DEC
writes it.

   The indirect character is `*' for Unix compatibility, not `@' as DEC
writes it.

   The displacement sizing character is ``' (an accent grave) for Unix
compatibility, not `^' as DEC writes it.  The letter preceding ``' may
have either case.  `G' is not understood, but all other letters (`b i l
s w') are understood.

   Register names understood are `r0 r1 r2 ... r15 ap fp sp pc'.  Upper
and lower case letters are equivalent.

   For instance
     tstb *w`$4(r5)

   Any expression is permitted in an operand.  Operands are comma
separated.

9.40.7 Not Supported on VAX
---------------------------

Vax bit fields can not be assembled with `as'.  Someone can add the
required code if they really need it.

9.41.1 Options
--------------

`as' supports the following additional command-line options for the
V850 processor family:

`-wsigned_overflow'
     Causes warnings to be produced when signed immediate values
     overflow the space available for then within their opcodes.  By
     default this option is disabled as it is possible to receive
     spurious warnings due to using exact bit patterns as immediate
     constants.

`-wunsigned_overflow'
     Causes warnings to be produced when unsigned immediate values
     overflow the space available for then within their opcodes.  By
     default this option is disabled as it is possible to receive
     spurious warnings due to using exact bit patterns as immediate
     constants.

`-mv850'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850 processor.  This allows the linker to detect
     attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850e'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850E processor.  This allows the linker to detect
     attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850e1'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850E1 processor.  This allows the linker to
     detect attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850any'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850 processor but support instructions that are
     specific to the extended variants of the process.  This allows the
     production of binaries that contain target specific code, but
     which are also intended to be used in a generic fashion.  For
     example libgcc.a contains generic routines used by the code
     produced by GCC for all versions of the v850 a
